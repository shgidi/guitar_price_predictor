Well balanced sound.  I've played bass through it as well and it performs like a champ.  Included is an Auralex isolation pad which fits the cab perfectly and helps to decouple it from the floor.

2018-02-28 08:21:00,"Carl Martin Delayla XL Pedal

Carl Martin DeLayla XL

The Carl Martin DeLayla XL is designed and developed with one goal in mind: To create a superior echo pedal, with the same sonic quality as the original DeLayla but with new extended features, yet incorporating some of the same features used in vintage tape delay units. To achieve this, they incorporated a second delay head (slapback) (similar to using two heads simultaneously on a tape delay). The SLAPBACK footswitch is used to turn the second delay head on or off. The SLAPBACK knob controls the mix of main delay vs. second delay head. Clockwise movement favors the second delay head; Counter clockwise favors the main delay. The SB-TRIM knob fine tune the second delay head's time setting compared to the original delay head, by this it's possible to create different delay patterns, going from strict slapback to way offbeat.

The TEMPO tap is a real time tempo learn function, allowing you to foot tap the delay time to match the exact beat of the song. The Carl Martin DeLayla XL also features a built in regulated power supply. The result is a warm, smooth sound reminiscent of the vintage tape units used in the 50's and 60's, combined with modern features. The Carl Martin DeLayla XL is able to capture one of the hardest sounds: That authentic rock'n roll slapback echo, that digital processors are unable to emulate.

Features:

Analog Delay plus the hard to recreate ""Slapback"" effect
Second Delay Tap similar to using two heads simultaneously on a tape delay
Tap Mix Knob lets you balance it just right
Built in regulated power supply
Hand Made in Denmark

For anything from bedroom studio tone to crushing live venue stage volume, this amp is IT and more

All of the amp models from the famous POD plus, this MKII especially has some truly wonderful sounds

A true modelling amp classic mated with Reinhold Bogner's infamous tube amp designing capability

Many compare to the Bogner Alchemist, though this Line 6 Bogner Valve MKII really has more sounds

Excellent condition and a very, VERY loud 40 Watts, enough for any stage or to drive a 4 X 12 cabinet

Plenty of reviews on-line and many people just never let go of these amps, which are very dependable

Tubes (valves) are in excellent working condition, and so is the original Celestion Vintage 30 speaker

""Spider Valve MkII amplifiers are the result of a groundbreaking collaboration between Line 6 and Reinhold Bogner. Boutique-style amp designs combine with the most advanced Line 6 amp modeling to deliver muscular tube tone and unsurpassed sonic flexibility. The amp and effect modeling flows into the Bogner-designed 12AX7 preamp and 6L6 power amp, and the result is a guitar-playing experience unlike any other.""

Modeling upstarts meet the tube guru.

In 2007, Line 6 approached Reinhold Bogner with a radical idea. We wanted the tube-amp legend to lend his world-renowned expertise, experience and imagination on a revolutionary new series of guitar amplifiers. After careful consideration he remarked, ""This opens up a world of possibilities ... let's see what we can do with it!""

More info on just the basic amp models (can be tweaked and added to considerably);

AMP MODELS


Clean Amber	One of the best-feeling clean tones we've ever made, Clean Amber is highly responsive to the player's touch. Scooped and boasting a beautiful high-end shimmer, it's inspired by* the clean tones of a Marshall® JCM-900.	


Clean Blue	Inspired by* some aspects of a Hiwatt® Custom 100, Clean Blue emulates the classic clean tones of the late 60s/early 70s. This model is full-bodied with a creamy mid-range and a tight low-end.	


Twang Amber	Twang Amber is inspired by* the sound of a 60s Fender® Blackface Twin Reverb® to produce a classic Nashville spank. Crank the Drive knob for some extra grit and growl!	


Twang Blue	More aggressive than Twang Amber, Twang Blue has plenty of cut, punch and attitude inspired by* a 60s Fender® Blackface Deluxe Reverb®.	


NEW! Class A Amber	Brilliant, singing tones with an addictive chime made famous by generations of Brit-rockers, Class A Amber is inspired by* a Vox® AC30 Top Boost.	


NEW! Class A Blue	Terrifically dynamic, Class A Blue offers boutique-style feel inspired by* some of our favorite amps including the Divided by 13 9/15. Sweet tones on the edge of breaking up give way to seriously throaty Overdrive when the Drive knob is cranked.	


Blues Amber	The vintage charm of Blues Amber is inspired by* the classic tones of a '50s wide panel Fender® Deluxe Reverb®.	


NEW! Blues Blue	Voiced with more attitude than Blues Amber, Blues Blue delivers a more forward mid-range for a classic rockabilly sound inspired by* the bite of a pint-sized Gretsch® 6156.	


Crunch Amber	A celebration of the tone used by numerous early metal bands, Crunch Amber was inspired by* the signature crunch of a '68 Marshall® Plexi 50-Watt.	


NEW! Crunch Blue	Crunch Blue provides a rounded off British-style distortion with a cool mid-honk and great cut. Inspired by* the killer crunch of an Orange® AD30.	


Hi Gain Amber	Hi Gain Amber is inspired by* the infamous brown sound of a '68 Marshall® Plexi 100-Watt with a Variac and jumped input channels.	


NEW! Hi Gain Blue	A modern, scooped metal sound, Hi Gain Blue is a refined distortion inspired by* the high-gain mayhem of a Diezel® Herbert.	


Metal Amber	A one-way ticket to high-gain heaven, Metal Amber is tight, punchy and inspired by* the high-gain tone of a Mesa/Boogie® Dual Rectifier®.	


Metal Blue	Metal Blue delivers high-gain aggression with supreme versatility. Sweep the Mid knob to control the character of the distortion! (Set it to minimum for fuzz pedal characteristics; set it to noon for creamy, modern high-gain tones; set it to max to conjure Class A tones.)	


Insane Amber	Dialed in for shredding, Insane Amber combines the intensity and impact of Metal Blue but it delivers more mid-range teeth for that bone-crushing grind. Inspired by* the tone of a Mesa/Boogie® Dual Rectifier® (red channel).	


Insane Blue	Insane Blue delivers an obscene helping of distortion while still retaining tonal definition and character. As much input gain distortion as possible short of a complete meltdown!;

2018-02-27 21:39:00,"Hello Everyone, 

I'm selling my Takamine Acoustic-Electric. It's a phenomenal guitar. The only reason I'm selling is because I sorely need the money, and I find that I mostly play my electric guitar these days.

The action is perfect, as is the sound. I believe it was built in 2008 in Japan (which is highly desirable). I can provide the serial number if you wish to do your own research. It includes the original hardshell case (with humidifier), which the guitar has been stored in since bought new. I just re-strung it last night with fancy Elixer strings and the thing sounds like a damn Martin D-28. The guitar is basically mint aside from a blemish on the soundhole. Purely cosmetic and doesn't affect the sound whatsoever. I'm a terrible photographer, but I did my best. It's best to see it in person. Online, you can find these used selling for over $1,000. Here's the same exact guitar on sale on Reverb: https://reverb.com/item/3398061-takamine-ef340sc-gn-mahogany

Come by and have a look! 

It's a great guitar, but I'm finding myself in some dire financial straits. 

Cheers,

- Peter

2018-02-27 21:11:00,"The Hughes & Kettner Triamp MK 1 is a complex, feature-laden amp that boasts an all-tube signal path. Sporting a 100W power section with 4 EL34's or 6L6GC's, along with 9 - count 'em - NINE 12AX7A's, spring reverb, also an optional MIDI control module, buffered FX Loop with db pad switch, H&K's Famous RED BOX DI, Line Out, selectable mains voltage, and Power Tube Failure indicator.

On the front panel, Three individual channels, each with two dedicated modes, dedicated EQ, Gain (one for each mode per amp - a total of six!) and Volume controls are topped off by a global master volume, Presence, and FX Loop Level control. Each channel's modes are switchable via push buttons on the face panel, or heavy duty footswitch.

UTILIZATION

The Triamp is a massive, heavy beast of an amp head, using only the best chassis material and components. A peek inside reveals a landscape of precision resistors, F&T and Vishay capacitors, as well as expertly laid ribbon cabling. The transformers are some of the largest I've ever seen in a 100 watt amp.

The EQ is responsive across all channels, and there is plenty of gain on tap for every need.

SOUNDS

AMP 1 is the clean channel. Mode 1 gives a very spanky, ballsy clean that can get slightly hairy with the gain turned up. Very touch responsive. About as close to a Fender clean as I've heard in a non-Fender amp. Kicking it into Mode 2 ups the gain and the low-end response, achieving a more Vox-like clean tone which overdrives quite well with a pedal. Not as bright as Mode 1.

Amp 2 is voiced for classic plexi-style tones. Mode 1 offers up a very thin, bright sound. Mode 2 ups the gain and the low-end. Great classic-rock sounds are found here, with plenty of midrange grind and fuzzy Marshall highs.

Amp 3 is voiced for high gain. This channel has a very strong, tight low-mid emphasis, which is typical of German high gain amps. Mode 1 produces a bright, tight grind that is great for chugging. Mode 2 goes all-out, adding even more gain and thunderous low-end response.

The FX Loop is great, allowing pedals to be implemented without much loss or coloring to the overall tone. The Red Box DI was useful for running a line to Front Of House and allowing the engineer to mix that signal with the signal mic'd from my speaker cabinet.

A great multi-use guitar amp. Nothing wrong with it. Haven't played in 5 years and need the space. Let me know if you have any questions.    ",https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/msg/d/hughes-kettner-triamp-mk1-mk/6477771403.html,1400.0,Hughes & Kettner TriAmp MK1 MK 1 MKI Guitar Tube Amp

This is a one-of-a-kind custom build that was put together in 2002.
The body is from a 1964 Fender Duo-Sonic II.
The bridge is from a 1965 Duo-Sonic.
The control plate is from a 1964 Fender Mustang.
The pickguard is from a 1966 Fender Mustang.
The neck is from the original run of mid-90s anniversary Fender Jagstangs.
The tuning pegs are not original.
All electronics, pickups, knobs, and switches are from Carvin, including a single-coil pickup in the neck position and a hot rails style humbucker in the bridge position.
The finish is a unique blue to purple burst. 

The guitar plays surprisingly well. It has great action and is one of the best guitars I have ever played.

A Leo Fender original creation: 1980 G&L F-100 Series I solid body electric in excellent playing condition and very good cosmetic condition. All original except the tremolo bar (modern reproduction replacement) and missing plastic tip from pickup selector switch. Mahogany body, maple neck/board with 12"" fretboard radius, medium C neck carve. Neck is dead straight, truss rod works, frets in great condition with no wear. Tremolo is phenomenal and holds tune reliably. Guitar feels and plays rock solid. Dual MFD humbuckers are hot but clear and full-range, with lots of highs and lows as well as mid thickness. Switching options allow for a variety of sounds, including a single coil mode and out of phase mode for thinner, phasey tone.
Nitro lacquer finish, perhaps over poly. Overall this guitar is very clean especially considering its age.

This is one of the rarest Aria models from the famed Matsumoku factory in Japan, you often see the Thor Sound models with humbuckers but this single coil version is really hard to find.

Amazing maple neck with a rosewood fretboard that's effortless to play, beautiful ash body, and top notch hardware. 

Plays great with nice low action. Comes with a brand new Gibson USA gig bag.

2018-02-27 12:34:00,"This is a great guitar cab made in England by Marshall. It has four Marshall G-12 speakers which sound fantastic with any amp head in the world. The angled design spreads the sound out higher towards your ears than a flat face cabinet. It has multiple impedance settings, 4/16-ohm mono 280W or 8-ohm stereo 140W each.

All of the building materials are of the highest quality, black elephant textured vinyl around the outside looks great. The wheels are very sturdy and it rolls well.You won't find a higher quality guitar cab. This retails for $1249 new from many retailers.

The cab has been lightly used, though it was bought around 8 years ago. It was shipped long distance one time, but only used for a couple performances ever. There is very little wear and tear on it. A small part of the M in the Marshall logo on the front has broken off, and there is a small amount of wear on the top from guitar amp heads, and there are a few small dings. Otherwise this looks and performs like new.

1. Boss Mega Distortion MD-2. Ok condition, some chips and missing level knob. $40

The Boss MD-2 Mega Distortion pedal adds a ton of grit to your tone, and gives you control over the bottom end of your sound for chunky lows. The bottom end dial sits inside the tone knob next to distortion and gain boost controls. Take your sound from a bluesy overdriven distortion, all the way to metal mayhem with the extended range of the Boss MD-2 Mega Distortion.

This is a spring loaded pedal that is activated by simply stepping on it and de-activated by simply stepping off.

This is a new Concert Classical Guitar built by the Polish luthier Zaneta Juskiewicz. This guitar has a really sweet tone, it's set-up very well, and it looks gorgeous. The frets are larger, and are very comfortable to play. The finish is a light oil resin that is very durable. This is a great bargain for a unique looking concert classical guitar. I had renowned NY luthier John Bertsche do a complete set up and also changed the nut & saddle to TUSQ black graphite. Comes with professionally installed Shadow SH-PFC-WC Panaflex Wireless Classical Guitar Pickup - an extra $500 when purchased new.

Hercules Stands EZ Clutch Music Stand

The BS301B EZ Clutch music stand is proof that even gear as essential and basic as a music stand benefits from advancing technology. Hercules totally nails it, offering a stand with several handy features.

First off, it has a desk with an upper half that folds down when not in use, utilizing a side locking pin to keep it firmly closed. When you're ready to play, simply press the pin to open the desk back up and lock it in position with the clip on back.

Then there is the EZ Angle Roller, which is equipped with a special frictioning rubber that holds the desk at the perfect angle while also being instantly adjustable. A simple push of the Quik-N-Easy Retainer's lever up or down makes it possible for instant desk mounting and dismounting. The same is true for the EZ Clutch which lets you adjust the height of the upper tube with the same simple lever push action.

The tilting base lets the music stand angle from 90 to 75 degrees, to reach positions more suited for your needs. It's swivel legs fit around other equipment, perfect for crowded stages. Simply pull up on the locking ring for compact packing. Last, but not least, the legs have 2 peg holes for adding an optional instrument peg so you can store your instrument when not in use, or a second instrument without taking up any extra floor space.

2018-02-27 09:05:00,"Selling an incredible Jackson SLS Soloist guitar in excellent condition. Wouldn't let it go but I have another Soloist with a Floyd and I play that one more often, so looking to make some space by sending this one off to a great new home. These Japanese models are miles above the Indonesian stuff Jackson is putting out today. 

This Japanese beauty has the very best of everything:

Body: Mahogany with carved top
Neck: Neck-thru-body mahogany with scarf joint headstock
Tuning machines: [original tuners upgraded to Gotoh Magnum Locking tuners - $75]
Fingerboard: Ebony
Frets: 24 jumbo frets
Pickups: upgraded to Seymour Duncan JB and Jazz set (originally had two Duncan 59s...this is a way better combo!)
Controls: Master volume [tone pot has been removed but you can easily put it back if you prefer it that way]
Hardware: [all upgraded to gold...much better look with the brilliant white finish!]
Inlays: MOTO shark fin position markers
Binding: Ivoroid neck and headstock

Also includes a custom inlaid truss cover that matches the guitar perfectly (you can see it in the front headstock pic). 

If you check out the last pic I posted of the screenshot from Guitar Center, their online used gear site has one of this exact model in black available for over $1000 ($950+tax), so my price is a killer deal! MSRP was $1999 when these came out. 

Cash only (no trades please) and pickup only in Windsor Terrace, right by Prospect Park off the F train Fort Hamilton stop. 

Thanks for looking!

Check Ebay, and you'll see the cheapest price on one of these stock is $1300, so this one's priced to sell!

I upgraded the pickups from the stock Dimarzio-made MMK45s (which are amazing pickups in their own right and are included) to a set of handwound Electric City PAF pickups. These pickups are almost $300 a set when you can find one, and they sound absolutely incredible. 

The guitar is in great shape with a few minor cosmetic dings [but hey, if you're nearly 40 years old you've probably got one or two yourself!]. No structural issues of any kind, plays and sounds fantastic. 

Hardshell case is included. Cash only, pickup only. Looking to thin the herd a bit, ended up with a few too many great guitars and want to find this guy a great new home.

2018-02-27 08:21:00,"Selling a used A/DA MP-1 Guitar Preamp. My good buddy owned it for years and had it modded so it sounds much better than stock, before gifting it to me. It's extremely versatile, going from very clean to bluesy overdrive to marshall rawwwk to 80s metal scooped shredz. Plus it has a really awesome sounding chorus effect that you can program the depth/rate for each preset (or just leave it out). Also it's midi controllable so you can easily use in a live or studio setting with a foot controller.

The cosmetic issues are as follows:
- Output jack A needs to be replaced, but Output jack B works perfectly fine (only need 1 jack for mono guitar sources, but you can replace jack A for a few bucks.
- plastic knob on front panel output level missing (works perfectly fine though)
- hole drilled in front panel over clip gain indicator (really wouldn't need to worry if you're just running instrument level signals through it).
- rack rash - scratches and a tiny ding or two

To be honest I'm actually surprised at how good it sounds for a 30 year old guitar pre. Both the clean and clean tube modes sound excellent and are great pedal platforms, and the heavier overdrive modes can go from bluesy to marshally to 80s metal scooped. Each preset can be adjusted with 4 band eq (bass, mid, treble, presence), chorus (depth/rate), 2 overdrive levels (effected depending on which ""voicing mode you select), a master gain (so you can set your levels to be similar volume, and voicing (clean, clean tube and distortion modes I believe). You can edit the presets to your liking or create your own. Also you can hook this up to a midi controller for changing between presets during a gig or studio session.

Selling for $250 cash.

Beautiful to Look at as Well as Play!

What a Bass! Only used one time for a recording session.
The Gold Tone fretless M-BASS with fret markers is a short scale bass that produces the same pitches as a standard bass instrument and is tuned in traditional bass tuning, E-A-D-G. This M-BASS is strung with Aquila proprietary strings that incorporate a great bass feel with balanced tension. The tone that this M-Bass produces is amazing and it's pure pleasure to play. Comes with a heavily padded gig bag.

The MicroBass M-Bass/FL, is a 25"" short-scaled fretless acoustic/electric bass guitar that utilizes a dedicated Aquila ""MicroBass"" synthetic string and a piezo transducer pickup. The extended scale length greatly improves intonation over similar models and allows for an acoustic volume loud enough to enjoy without plugging into an amplifier. The sloped ergo-glide top makes this instrument extremely comfortable to hold.

The MicroBass features a built-in transducer pickup with a master volume control as well as independent bass and treble tone controls. There is also a built-in electronic tuner with mute function that will aid in quick and accurate pitch adjustments. When the tuner is engaged, the instrument output is muted. When a 1/4"" instrument cable is inserted into the output jack, the tuner is automatically engaged and the instrument is muted. By pressing the tuner button, the tuner is disengaged and the bass output will be audible.

MicroBass models feature an active pickup, which means that a battery is required for the pickup to function. The battery and can be accessed in the built-in preamp on the upper bout of the instrument. The MicroBass uses a 9v battery, which can be accessed under the plastic cover on the backside of the instrument opposite the volume and tone controls. A battery is included with all new MicroBasses.

This MicroBass does include a 5-year factory warranty.

Hollowbody Electric Guitar with Maple Top, Back, and Sides; Maple Neck; Rosewood Fretboard; 2 Humbucking Pickups; and Bigsby Vibrato - Black
G5422TDC Electromatic Double-cutaway hollowbody

Includes Proper Gretsch Hard-Case.


""Gretsch G5422TDC Double-cutaway hollowbody electric guitar to get that unmistakable Gretsch twang. Laden with professional features, the G5422TDC Electromatic Double-cutaway hollowbody boasts vintage-voiced Gretsch ""Black Top"" humbucking pickups, an Adjusto-matic bridge, and a Bigsby B60 tailpiece for the subtle pitch modulation that has become synonymous with Gretsch. Three-way pickup switching and four controls, including a master volume, ensure you'll have no problem conjuring the legendary tones the G5422TDC hollowbody was built for.""

No nonsense, Electromatic hollow-body guitars are the perfect real, pure and powerful Gretsch instruments. They're your next-step Gretsch--bold, dynamic and articulate, and crafted with essential Gretsch sound, style and playability.

Sleek yet aggressive, the G5422T has a thinner, fully hollow build with a true Filter'Tron™ voice that captures the resonant hollow-body sound with a more present and chiming voice. Like all Electromatic guitars, it delivers the fearless and electrifying authenticity that has set Gretsch apart as the quintessential rock 'n' roll guitars from the very beginning. It's the sound of honor itself--play proud.

Premium features include:

• Dual ""Black Top"" Filter'tron humbucking pickups
• Versatile upgraded controls including master volume treble-bleed circuit
• Oversized bound F holes and aged multi-ply body binding
• Smaller late-'50s G6120 bound headstock
• Graph Tech® NuBone™ nut
• Pearloid Neo-Classic ""thumbnail"" fingerboard inlays
• Bigsby® B60 vibrato tailpiece

http://www.guitarcenter.com/Martin/Standard-Series-D-41-Dreadnought-Acoustic-Guitar-1273887990865.gc?pdpSearchTerm=martin%20d-41

This guitar was made in 2012, and is in very clean condition.  Except for a few very small marks on the top, it's a solid 9 out of 10.

It also features a factory-installed Fishman Matrix Infinity pickup, with volume and tone controls hidden just inside the soundhole.  See it here: http://www.guitarcenter.com/Fishman/Matrix-Infinity-Acoustic-Guitar-Under-Saddle-Pickup.gc

This is a fantastic sounding guitar, and very much in a class of it's own compared to standard-fare D-28s and the like.  It has a vibrant, brilliant tone that inspires you to forget about everything else and just keep playing.  Seriously.  It has only been played around the house, and has a nice open, played-in sound.

2018-02-26 21:05:00,"This bass is all original and in extremely good condition playing wise, with some marks of distinction, as expected for an instrument this age. I put a few hundred dollars into having this bass re-fretted and it received a set up from Retrofret. Because of this, this particular bass is one of the best players you'll come across, with an arrow-straight neck, fast/comfortable action and great intonation all the way up the neck.

It's a great vintage bass (early 60's) with unique feel and sound to it and it was my main player for a long time and with no reservations, playing all types of music while touring US and overseas, television performances, etc, and has even shared the stage with David Byrne (who apparently dug it and asked why I brought a different bass to the next performance). The semi-hollow body makes it very light yet these basses are known for their deep bass and clear highs. 

One of my favorites but have to sell it and hoping it goes to a good home!

Product Information
Made In The USA
This Gibson J-100 Xtra Acoustic/Electric Guitar From 2004 is part of the guitar maker's Gibson Super Jumbo family. The J-100 Xtra engineering is also inspired by the classic SJ-100 that was a favorite of artists in the 1930s. These models are designed with larger bodies to produce a greater range of sound. This six-string machine features a solid and scalloped-braced Sitka spruce top and bubinga on the back and sides. This combination delivers an impressive and warm midrange response as well as a thundering bottom. The Gibson J-100 Xtra comes with a Fishman transducer, promising excellent acoustic amplification. It has an antique natural finish, a maple wood round neck and mustache, and a fingerboard constructed from Indian rosewood. Used by everyone from the Beatles to Led Zeppelin and Cream, the Gibson is a classic machine that delivers folk, country, hard rock, and blues.

With a solid spruce top, solid mahogany back and sides and a Brazilian Rosewood fretboard and it is thought to have a somewhat crisper sound with more definition in the top-end. The D18 model was a favorite of David Crosby and Elvis Presley. 

Light as a feather but puts out some of the most incredible sound. Lots of resonant bottom end and sharp clear high notes. Great guitar to add to any collection you may have. The guitar is very dynamic, responding to your lightest picking and more authoritative strums without losing definition.

Cosmetically, the guitar has some scratches and finish checks as seen in the photos. With time this guitar will only increase in price.

Included is a Fishman Rare Earth Magnetic Soundhole Mic Pickup system, which sells for $289 at Sweetwater Sound and hard shell case. Phone calls only please. Call Adam  show contact info

Nail the toughest licks at your own pace!

The TASCAM CD-GT1mkII Portable CD Guitar Trainer is the ultimate training and jamming tool for guitarists, vocalists, and other musicians. Take any favorite CD, plug your guitar directly into the CD-GT1's 1/4"" input, put on some headphones, set the volume, and start rocking! Vocalists can do the same with a mic. 

The Slow Speed Audition feature lets you learn licks note-for-note by slowing down the CD up to 50% without changing the pitch. You can also increase the tempo in steps until you match the original performance. Added features include a guitar-cancelling function, built-in metronome, and oscillators for tuning, and split monitoring.

Advanced players can use the CD-GT1's pitch and speed controls to audition various keys and tempi for CDs they've burned of their own music. 

The CD-GT1 has 57 great-sounding, customizable effects including distortion, delay, chorus, and more. There's also a nice selection of vocal reverbs and processed sounds so you can sing along with rockers, hip-hoppers, divas, and everything in-between! 

You can set seamless in-out loop points with the CD-GT1 so that it plays the same passage over and over again so you can nail phrases. Use the footswitch input to start playing the CD from any designated point or to scroll through effects. 

You can listen on headphones, or use its line output to plug in speakers. The CD-GT1 even provides a chromatic tuner and operates on batteries to take your show on the road. Optional AC power supply. (See accessory box on this page.)

Small sized head you can carry to a show and plug in or use with the cab for practice. Two 8 Ohm speaker outputs or one 16 Ohm.

I retubed the amp with JJ-Electronics tubes for a better tone. I used to run a sunface fuzz through it and it sounded beautiful. Some thick hendrixy cream tones. I bought it for a blues / psychedelic band I was in but I don't play anymore so it's been wrapped up in my closet for a few years.

2006 model. Excellent condition with only minor swirling. The guitar's never been gigged while in my possession and is in great shape. I bought it about 4 years ago to use at home for writing and recording after I switched to drums. Straight neck, little to no fret wear. The frets were recently polished and the fret edges were smoothed out. Currently tuned to C# standard tuning with very low action. I can set it up for whatever tuning you like though.

This is now a somewhat rare guitar, the newer versions don't have the eagle inlays and do have a Kahler but I vastly prefer Floyds, which this one has. I love the guitar, I've written lots of music on it and recorded it a lot too. I dont really want to sell it but I need the money so off it goes.

Really warm, big sound. No tinny tone from the EMG's. Keeps up with my $2600 USA Jackson Rhoads any day, which one is better only depends on what song im working on but this one is more comfortable to sit down with (the reason I got it). The neck is excellent too, very thin, fast, slick and flat but feels really high quality. 

It sounds great and plays like a dream. Comes with the original whammy bar.

This is an awesome guitar which PRS no longer makes so they are very hard to find. Really subtle but elegant carved black flame maple top and back, 22 wide-fret mahogany set-neck (these frets are like new), rosewood fretboard with abalone bird inlay, PRS adjustable stop-tail bridge, rosewood tuner buttons, and McCarty Archtop pickups with 3-way toggle.

Its build quality and components are like a fine luxury car, and the black flame is in my opinion super cool (and fairly rare in these model guitars).

This rare Vox Virage DC sounds and plays like a dream. See specs below and email or text with any questions.  Priced for a quick sale.  Good Luck.

The Virage DC is a solid wood semi-hollowbody guitar that features Integral Tonebar construction that keeps feedback at bay and yields the warm, singing resonance of a semi-hollow instrument with the focused attack of a solidbody. A custom, hand-carved neck joint with an inverse heel offers greatly enhanced upper fret access and comfort in the highest registers.

Innovative features include an ergonomically curved bodies, contoured both along its length and across its width. This unique curvature hugs close to the player, and, when combined with the guitars' slightly smaller than typical body size and their arched-top profile, affords a comfortable right arm playing position unlike previous semi-hollow offerings, as well as overall unprecedented playing comfort. The result is a guitar that fits perfectly whether the guitarist is sitting or standing.

The Virage DC employs the proprietary VOX Three-90 Pickup System, which relies on two triple-coil pickups to deliver clean, crunch and lead tones, similar to having single coil, P-90 and humbucking-style versatility all in one instrument. Its analog circuitry requires no batteries or active electronics, and provides hum free operation regardless of the tone selected. This pickup system was designed and built in the USA exclusively for VOX by DiMarzio. A three-way toggle makes selecting pickups quick and easy. Users can jump between clean, crunch and lead modes independently for each pickup with a quick flick of each pickup's 3-way mode switch.

The specially designed VOX Full Contact aluminum bridge provides thick, rich tone with clear harmonics. Extended saddle travel ensures perfect intonation for any gauge string. String loading from the back edge of the bridge enables quick and effortless string changes.

Am often on the Upper East Side of Manhattan weekly for rehearsals if this helps (just ask)
Can meet anywhere along Rte 84 from Danbury to Fishkill / Newburgh Beacon Bridge
Occasionally in Ulster County near Kingston, Woodstock, or New Paltz for work


If YOU are READING this ad, then it is STILL available, right NOW, no need to ask... ;-) 




 Bought this and then before it arrived found a vintage tube amp that I wanted locally
  So here is a brand new amp that I want to sell in order to finance my other project

 Make me an offer or open to possible trade / trades for music, pro audio, recording gear, or ?

They are out of production, probably could not manufacture / hand wire and make a profit

Company is USA based, run by Veterans, Spec Ops, Mako 18 Watt High Gain Head

Still in original box, just as it came to me delivered here, I paid $350, yours now for $325 bucks OBO

 Hand wired, point to point (PTP) soldered, high quality components and excellent workmanship

Can't even find a hand wired amp USED for $350 - $400, much less brand new like this one

More info;

The Mako amp was designed to be a version of the classic 18 watt high gain, classic hand wired, amp.

Consider these features:

· Large (10""), heavy duty, rubber carry handle with spring steel insert. This is larger and better padded than others and is held in with ""T"" nuts (not just screwed into the top of the cabinet) for high strength.

· Large, two screw, steel corners with ""Lip"". Sure these are more expensive than others, but the built in ""lip"" protects the corners better. Covered in a thick, tough powder coat.

· The amp enclosure is made in the USA using full 18mm thick PLYWOOD - No MDF!!! Plywood is more expensive and harder to work with than MDF but is much stronger... no shortcuts here.

· The amp enclosure has four large rubber feet for non-slip stability with steel inserts for strength

· The amp enclosure is covered in a tough ""Elephant"" tolex (except as noted) for extreme wear resistance and long lasting good looks.

· The front of the amp features a heavy gauge expanded steel insert. This insert protects the internal components of the amp but allows maximum cooling. This insert is extremely strong and lightweight. Coated in a thick powder coat.



Buried in the enclosure is the amp itself. The Mako amp was designed to re-create the classic high gain amps of the past with some very refined updates. It is still hand wired by skilled professionals making each amp unique and one of a kind.

· The chassis is manufactured from high grade 16 ga. formed steel. It is coated in a thick powder coat with PVC overlays.

· The ""Rooster Head"" knobs are made from a strong, heat resistant polymer. These knobs are easy to operate and easy to see (this is very important on poorly lit stages)

· Preamp Tubes: Three 12AX7 (ECC83)

· Power Tubes: Two EL84 (6BQ5)

· The Mako amp features two inputs: Normal and Lead

· The normal channel delivers crisp, sparkling sound that can be driven to ""break up"" by pushing the normal channel volume to overdrive the tubes.

· The lead channel can produce clean and the ultimate in high gain tones and anything in between. By varying the settings of the gain, volume, and master volume a huge variety of styles and modes can be produced.



The Mako also features a full set of controls:

· Lead Gain - This sets the gain structure for the Lead channel

· Normal Gain - This sets the gain structure for the Normal channel

· Lead Volume - This sets the preamp volume of the Lead channel

· Bass, Mid, Treble, Presence - EQ controls for shaping the tone

· Master Volume - Sets the overall output volume. When used in conjunction with the channel volume and gain knobs a surprising palette of sounds can be had at lower volumes.

· Power Switch - Hi = Power output set at full 18 watts, Mi = Power output set at 9 watts, Lo = Power output set to 4.5 watts (or half these values in Triode operation)



The Power switch is in the back, the standby switch (with LED) in front. This is another nod to the musicians who play live. The power is turned on at the beginning and the Standby switch is generally toggled on and off at set breaks.

The rear panel of the amp has the following features:

· ""Red Box"" DI - The XLR Red Box output is, in our opinion, the very best direct recording ""out"" available. The Red Box DI has a very precise speaker emulator for recording directly to media (computer, tape, HDD etc)

· Triode/Pentode switch - This switch can be engaged as a ""power soak"" for playing high-gain, powerful sounds at lower levels. It effectively cuts the output of the power tubes while retaining full power thru the preamp tubes.

· Speaker Outputs - 4 Ohm/8 Ohm/16 Ohm. Just about any variety of speaker cabinet can be accommodated.

The highest quality precision parts are used throughout for extremely low noise: 5 watt metal oxide power resistors, 600 volt polypropylene film/foil and polyester Military Specification capacitors, full military spec PC boards, and wound to spec transformers. These quality components are then HAND WIRED to the amp. This auction includes the amp itself and the power cord.

In the end we can quote features and specifications until the cows come home, but what REALLY matters is the sound. The Mako sounds amazing! It faithfully recreates the sound of vintage 18 watt high gain amps at a fraction of the price. Of course ""beauty is in the ear of the beholder"" and that is why we invite you to try one today!

The guitar has a rich, full sound that really reverberates and has been such a joy to play both acoustically and plugged in.  Unfortunately, I am majorly downsizing and so the time has come to say goodbye.  The guitar didn't come with a case, but I am throwing one in for free because all guitars should have a case for protection from the elements.  I will also throw a strap in for free.  The guitar is in excellent condition with a surface scratch (pictured) which does not affect the sound.  Please don't hesitate to ask any questions you might have.  I really want this beauty to go to a good home where she will be played!

2018-02-26 13:09:00,"This is a rare item designed by a top notch audio mastering engineer named Ross Nyberg.
http://nybergmastering.com/testimonials/
It follows the design sonic of a mastering room with angled and no angled surfaces. I don`t know how he did it (see pics) but the cab has the bottom of a 1-15 without the bass trap boominess. I LOVE this cab but I`m traveling light this year.
It's not really heavy as it might look ... balances well.
20 1/2 wide
12 1/2 deep
19 tall (add 3/4"" for rubber feet)
weight approx. 40lbs
Weber California 80w 8ohm speaker with very low hours on it.
I bought this from a pro player who is a mix engineer who said he had maybe 5 hours on it. I`ve used it for maybe 4 gigs since I stored it in NY and I`ve been on the road all year.
I`m going to move it before March 12th so here it is.
I`ve used it for Bari Gtr and it`s incredible ...think of those Forte cabs with the side ports for dispersion.
There`s one little scuff if you look hard but it`s in great shape.
As proof that I should not unscrew stuff ..I took out the speaker to get a pic of the guts and the screwdriver rolled out of my hand and slowly rested on the cone ... you can see two small dimples that just happened but there was no impact.

Designed and built under the supervision of Takamine's head luthiers, G-Series guitars are created to serve all players from the hobbyist to professional. The GS330S dreadnought (The most popular body shape of the past half century, the Dreadnought delivers a strong low end with plenty of volume) is known throughout the industry as the best playing acoustic guitar at this price level. Features a solid cedar top for a warm, deep resonant tone while the ultra light satin finish adds to the overall resonance of the guitar. The mahogany neck and dual action adjustable tension rod keeps the guitar playing true no matter what the environment. A super fast neck and amazing tone make this our most popular G-Series guitar.

If you look at the pictures, you can see that there is some damage to the back of the guitar when it slid into the corner of a coffee table.  The effect on the sound is negligible.  I've had this thing for years and it still looks, sounds and plays wonderfully.

Back - Nato
Sides - Nato

Solid cedar top - Solid Indian Rosewood back and sides - Ebony fingerboard - Bone nut and saddle. High quality gold tuners - Rosewood bridge and headstock facing - 650/52.

It is extremely clean playing - it has great articulation, crystal clear separation of notes. This is found more often on spruce than cedar. So I feel it is the best of both worlds - the warmth of cedar and the clarity of spruce. It also has great sustain.   

There are a few small dings on the top, and one tiny milky spot on the back.  Part of the rosette is darkened and slightly raised. Obviously none of this affects the sound, which is rich and Spanish.

Will meet to show the guitar in Westchester, Connecticut, or Riverdale.

The solid A+ Sitka spruce top generates great energy making this an exciting and responsive instrument suitable for any style of music. The Shadowburst finish on this guitar is stunning, carefully crafted to produce a mirror deep shine and sophisticated appearance. Each model is designed to get the best out of its solid top and components, and for them to work together to produce a tone and player experience, rarely found in affordable instruments.

These components include Alvarez's FST2M bracing system, a bi-level bridge, and a real bone nut and saddle. The sound is warm, open and powerful, and both the treble and bass registers are clearly present and balanced in relation to each other. These guitars feel right and are rewarding to play.

The AF610ESHB also comes with the Alvarez SYS250 EQ and pickup system, which comes with a 3-band EQ and a backlit chromatic digital tuner to ensure you sound great when you've plugged this sweet guitar up to an amp.

Collings OM2Hss (2002)
You know what this is.  One of the best acoustics made in America, or the world.  This model is a do-everything guitar: country, blues, finger style, strum.  Amazing projection, note articulation.  A studio killer.  The ""ss"" stands for short-scale, which makes it the Collings-equivalent of a Martin 000-28, and easier to play.  Recently set-up by luthier Anthony Marchitelli.   SN#8026, 2002.  In very good condition one slight finish crazing on top (hard to see).  Original top-notch Geib-style hard shell case. New, these go for 4200+, and there aren't a lot of Collings like this with 15+ years of age on them.  It's a total Thoroughbred.

Sadly, I'm selling this beautiful Big Baby Taylor Acoustic Guitar because I don't really play it and I have no room for it :(

Please note this model is the BIG Baby - it's bigger than the little ""Baby"" models but it's smaller than the full-body Taylors.
This is a perfect guitar for indoors playing, as it's not full size so it's not as clunky and loud as the full-body acoustics.
However, it's powerful enough to play in small stages or parks without a mic.

The guitar is in near mint condition. It's been played only at home, and only about 5 times. The guitar has always slept in its original Taylor gig bag with a humidifier so the wood is in perfect condition.

I'm including the gig bag and the humidifier.

This beauty is based on the Custom Shop Strat. Mark Sound makes some gorgeous pieces, and this one is a prime example. The body here is northern ash which gives it a fantastic 'Les Paul' midrange push. The perfect complement to the Fender pickups.
A trio of Fender USA pickups provide everything from crisp bridge sounds to warm neck cleans. Add overdrive to these beauties and they open right up with complex mids. The middle position is non RWRP, so you get classic Fender tones across the 5 way. The bridge position has the classic 'bite' with the body's mid push adding a nice touch. The neck pickup is absolutely stunning with thick syrupy sustain. Of course, you have your tight cleans and Hendrix overdrives from the '2' & '4' positions. A true tone machine.
The maple neck here has a great feel- .86"" deep at the 5th fret with an oval C profile. Super comfortable while the mass adds fantastic tone transfer. Add to that the 12"" fretboard radius and you have a bender's dream ax.
The look here is beautiful- orange sparkle finish, maple board, black dot inlays, and gold hardware.
This Mark Sound is in exceptional overall condition - nothing to report. The frets here are clean- setup with action just 3/32"" at the 12th fret low E.

The George Fedden acrylic guitars are custom made to order works of art.
This beauty features a solid red & clear acrylic body- in an 'offset Strat' design- just gorgeous.
The body here, combined with the 3/4 through bolt on neck, creates an incredible amount of natural sustain. Just huge tone, with a nice bite.
Grabbing up this tone are a trio of custom made pickups- a hum in the bridge and dual single coils.
These pickups provide exceptional clean and crunch tones.
The bridge position sounds big and warm- perfect for crunchy rhythms and searing leads.
The single coil in the neck provides some warm cleans and syrupy overdrive tones.
The way the middle pickup is wired gives this guitar a great amount of flexibility. It enganges off the p/p tone control- so you can add it to either pickup or have all 3 pickups on at the same time. Very cool.
The highly figured maple neck here has a great profile- .83"" deep at the 5th fret- with a comfortable soft V profile. 
Add to that the 10"" fretboard radius and you have a great player- a bender's dream.
The look is incredible- red/clear 'offset Strat' acrylic body, heavy figuring on the neck, star inlays, and chrome hardware.
This beauty is in very good overall condition- typical very light wear from normal light use and a small hairline in the wooden bridge pickup surround.

Wim passed away recently unfortunately, but, if you search him online, you'll see some of his other impressive builds.
As many of you are aware, we bought out NYC Bass Loft several years ago. The Bass Loft was the hang place for a number of world renowned bassists when they were in NY. The Bass Loft had all the high end luthier basses in stock. This Heins is the last piece we have from the buyout.
This bass is a handmade beauty. The body here looks to be walnut- absolutely gorgeous. This enables a warm tone with very good projection. The set maple neck adds great tone trasnfer as well as some nice high end mids.
This awesome natural tone is grabbed by the dual Bartolini J style pickups. These run into the 9v 2 band active EQ- Treble/Bass with an acitve/passive P/P off the volume. This puts a world of tones right at your fingertips. 
The set neck here is super thin- just .77"" deep at the 5th fret with a flat C profile. Super comfortable while the deep body cutaways and set design enable full access all the way to the 25th fret.
The look here is beautiful- the satin finish lets the wood grains really shine. Add to that the black hardware, 3+2 headstock, and large dot inlays and you have a work of art.

Laguna Ultimate Rock Rack Electric Guitar Pack with Spider III 15W Amp 3-Tone Sunburst

OVERVIEW
A rock-ready guitar plus modeling combo amp complete with all the extras for an unbelievable price!

Laguna and Line 6 have combined forces to produce the ultimate package for players looking for great rock tones. This ultimate rock pack includes the Laguna LE122 electric guitar, the Line 6 Spider III 15 modeling combo amplifier, and an extremely well-stocked accessory kit.

Laguna LE122 Electric Guitar
A high quality, feature rich, solid premium wood guitar with a comfort carved top. The maple neck is fast and comfortable and has a thick Indian rosewood fingerboard with offset markers for easy visibility. Uniquely wound humbuckers produce massive gain and feature a 3-position pickup switch. A traditional tremolo adds dive-bombing excitement to your solos.

Line 6 Spider III 15 Modeling Combo Amplifier
The Line 6 Spider III 15 Modeling Combo Amplifier delivers detailed amp models based on some of the greatest guitar sounds ever created. To keep these sounds authentic, Line 6 kidnapped some of the world's most notorious rock stars to dial in each amp model, including 311, Thursday, Lacuna Coil, Hawthorne Heights, Slipknot, Ash, Albert Lee, Athlete, John 5, and many more! Now you can rule the stage with the Insane model with its truly massive gain or explore your sensitive side in the studio with the Clean model. It's all up to you.

Amp Models:
Clean: Red LED - Select this Amp Model and adjust the tone controls to get crisp, amazing clean sounds, great warm jazz tones, and all the high-end shimmer you'll need with a generous amount of bottom end.

Crunch: Red LED - This sound was crafted during Line 6's studies* of the '68 Marshall Plexi 50 Watt. This type of Marshall amp was used by a number of early metal bands. Crunch provides a wider range of tone control settings than the original Marshall amp had.

Metal: Red LED - This Amp Model is based on* the Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier. Use this Amp Model to get a tight and punchy, high gain Metal sound.

Insane: Red LED - This model is Line 6's ""dialed in for shredding"" version based on* the Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier red channel. It combines the intensity and impact of Metal Red, but delivers more midrange and teeth for that bone-crushing, brain piercing insane grind.

Effects:
A great amp isn't the only part of a great guitar sound. With Smart Control FX, an exclusive Line 6 feature that automatically dials in different effect parameters, you spend more time playing and less time tweaking. Simply find the effect that you want, turn the knob to your desired intensity, and you're done. You can even use multiple effects at the same if you wanna get really crazy.

Effects Models (Up to 2 effects simultaneous)
Phaser
Chorus/Flanger
Tremolo
Sweep Echo
Tape Echo
Reverb

Ins & Outs
When you're playing with your band on stage just drag the Spider III on stage and crank it up. When it comes time to record, use the headphone/direct out and plug it straight into the mixing board for world-class POD 2.0 direct tone used in pro studios and stages everywhere! You can also use the same out with headphones for practicing in your bedroom. Want to play along with your favorite songs? Plug into the CD/MP3 input and you're good to go.

Plug in and separate yourself from the posers.

LAGUNA GUITARS LAUNCHES ""ONE GUITAR, ONE TREE"" REFORESTATION INITIATIVE

Laguna Guitars, reflecting the passionate convictions of musicians, celebrates Earth Day by launching their new ""One Guitar, One Tree"" reforestation initiative. This plan involves planting one tree for every Laguna guitar made. In addition, Laguna continues to deepen its other practical efforts to reduce waste, recycle and conserve the planet's resources.

For decades, musicians have proudly been socially aware and urged others to take more action, advocacy and awareness in environmental matters. As musicians themselves, those at Laguna have always passionately supported that position, knowing that trees are an economical, long-term solution to many tough environmental problems, including air and water pollution, climate change, wildlife protection, habitat restoration and more. In partnership with AmericanForests.org and their Global Relief campaign, Laguna proudly plants a tree for each Laguna guitar made.

In addition, Laguna's shipping cartons are designed to provide maximum protection with a minimum of material. Their boxes are made from 100% recycled cardboard that is also 100% recyclable, which they naturally encourage wherever possible. Also, in the interests of conservation, they have decided not to print glossy, heavyweight catalogs as millions from various companies end up in landfills every year. Instead, Laguna provides extensive information online at their website (www.playlaguna.com) and a catalog will soon be available as downloadable PDF's, allowing users to print only those pages they want.

Laguna Ultimate Rock Rack Electric Guitar Pack with Spider III 15W Amp 3-Tone Sunburst

OVERVIEW
A rock-ready guitar plus modeling combo amp complete with all the extras for an unbelievable price!

Laguna and Line 6 have combined forces to produce the ultimate package for players looking for great rock tones. This ultimate rock pack includes the Laguna LE122 electric guitar, the Line 6 Spider III 15 modeling combo amplifier, and an extremely well-stocked accessory kit.

Laguna LE122 Electric Guitar
A high quality, feature rich, solid premium wood guitar with a comfort carved top. The maple neck is fast and comfortable and has a thick Indian rosewood fingerboard with offset markers for easy visibility. Uniquely wound humbuckers produce massive gain and feature a 3-position pickup switch. A traditional tremolo adds dive-bombing excitement to your solos.

Line 6 Spider III 15 Modeling Combo Amplifier
The Line 6 Spider III 15 Modeling Combo Amplifier delivers detailed amp models based on some of the greatest guitar sounds ever created. To keep these sounds authentic, Line 6 kidnapped some of the world's most notorious rock stars to dial in each amp model, including 311, Thursday, Lacuna Coil, Hawthorne Heights, Slipknot, Ash, Albert Lee, Athlete, John 5, and many more! Now you can rule the stage with the Insane model with its truly massive gain or explore your sensitive side in the studio with the Clean model. It's all up to you.

Amp Models:
Clean: Red LED - Select this Amp Model and adjust the tone controls to get crisp, amazing clean sounds, great warm jazz tones, and all the high-end shimmer you'll need with a generous amount of bottom end.

Crunch: Red LED - This sound was crafted during Line 6's studies* of the '68 Marshall Plexi 50 Watt. This type of Marshall amp was used by a number of early metal bands. Crunch provides a wider range of tone control settings than the original Marshall amp had.

Metal: Red LED - This Amp Model is based on* the Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier. Use this Amp Model to get a tight and punchy, high gain Metal sound.

Insane: Red LED - This model is Line 6's ""dialed in for shredding"" version based on* the Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier red channel. It combines the intensity and impact of Metal Red, but delivers more midrange and teeth for that bone-crushing, brain piercing insane grind.

Effects:
A great amp isn't the only part of a great guitar sound. With Smart Control FX, an exclusive Line 6 feature that automatically dials in different effect parameters, you spend more time playing and less time tweaking. Simply find the effect that you want, turn the knob to your desired intensity, and you're done. You can even use multiple effects at the same if you wanna get really crazy.

Effects Models (Up to 2 effects simultaneous)
Phaser
Chorus/Flanger
Tremolo
Sweep Echo
Tape Echo
Reverb

Ins & Outs
When you're playing with your band on stage just drag the Spider III on stage and crank it up. When it comes time to record, use the headphone/direct out and plug it straight into the mixing board for world-class POD 2.0 direct tone used in pro studios and stages everywhere! You can also use the same out with headphones for practicing in your bedroom. Want to play along with your favorite songs? Plug into the CD/MP3 input and you're good to go.

Plug in and separate yourself from the posers.

LAGUNA GUITARS LAUNCHES ""ONE GUITAR, ONE TREE"" REFORESTATION INITIATIVE

Laguna Guitars, reflecting the passionate convictions of musicians, celebrates Earth Day by launching their new ""One Guitar, One Tree"" reforestation initiative. This plan involves planting one tree for every Laguna guitar made. In addition, Laguna continues to deepen its other practical efforts to reduce waste, recycle and conserve the planet's resources.

For decades, musicians have proudly been socially aware and urged others to take more action, advocacy and awareness in environmental matters. As musicians themselves, those at Laguna have always passionately supported that position, knowing that trees are an economical, long-term solution to many tough environmental problems, including air and water pollution, climate change, wildlife protection, habitat restoration and more. In partnership with AmericanForests.org and their Global Relief campaign, Laguna proudly plants a tree for each Laguna guitar made.

In addition, Laguna's shipping cartons are designed to provide maximum protection with a minimum of material. Their boxes are made from 100% recycled cardboard that is also 100% recyclable, which they naturally encourage wherever possible. Also, in the interests of conservation, they have decided not to print glossy, heavyweight catalogs as millions from various companies end up in landfills every year. Instead, Laguna provides extensive information online at their website (www.playlaguna.com) and a catalog will soon be available as downloadable PDF's, allowing users to print only those pages they want.

- reading music
- scales and technique
- jazz, classical, rock, blues, country, r&b styles
- improvisation

2018-02-25 21:12:00,"Details: 
Purchased new in 2013 from Guitar Center on 14th St, NYC for around $1,400.  

Serial No:  121031627 Model No:  LS02P6PBCH1

Comes with original black Gibson carrying case.  Made in the USA.

A few light scratches and some small dents from use.  Gorgeous tone.  Sounds great on recordings.
Heavy guitar made primarily for studio recording.  

Was used in 2014 for a 7 week run of an Off Broadway musical.  Also used for an EP recording in 2015 and on stage a few times with my band.  

The scoop:  As Gibsons often do, it tends to fall out of tune easily, so best for a lead guitar or a rhythm player with a lighter-touch than a punk rock strummer.  I am selling it because I primarily use my Telecaster now as it is better equipped to handle my aggressive strumming style, and so I haven't used the Gibson very much in the last 2 years.  Hence, parting ways.  

I'm located in Hamilton Heights.  You are more than welcome to try it out at my place with my Fender amp before making the purchase.  I accept Venmo, Paypal or cash.  

Thanks

2018-02-25 19:33:00,"1973-1975 Dallas Arbiter era Sound City 120. 

This one is very clean and works great. Very little 'white noise', which these can be known for due to the active eq. Speaking of the active eq, the one on this one sounds great and works great. A lot of people like to swap out the preamp for a Hiwatt-style or plexi-style but I decided to keep this one because I didn't find any reason to change. Also, you can plug in your favorite external eq into the 'slave input', which bypasses the onboard preamp and essentially turns this amp into a very powerful power amp.

I had this professionally gone over about a year ago and ended up with some new caps, 6 new JJ EL34 power tubes, and a 3-pronged cord. 

Works great as a 'clean platform' for pedals due to the huge Partridge transformers and 6 power tubes. Also has very nice gain on tap if you want.

Located in Brooklyn, NY.

2018-02-25 17:17:00,"Serial Number: 92032023 -- The serial number indicates that this was the 23rd instrument produced on July 21, 1992, which was the very first year of the J-60's production. It features a Sitka spruce top and rosewood back and sides. The J-60 is one of Gibson Acoustic's most powerful dreadnought square shoulder designs.  Production of the J-60 ended in 1999, but was re-introduced for one year only, in 2013.

A birthday gift from my (then) wife in August of 1992, it is in ""like-new"" condition. Having been little played (I was never really very good), it has been sitting on the top shelf of my closet for over 20 years. The only flaw is a slight 5mm nick (as shown in photo #3). The deluxe hardshell case is in good condition BUT is without its combination lock (as shown in photo #5).

Many consider this superior guitar to be an heirloom...research the Gibson J-60 on Google and decide for yourself. Here is a YouTube link to the story of the production of the J-60 and a demo of the prototype built as a personal project of John Lowell in 1991 (followed by production in 1992): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-X8by4Gbjg

Additionally, there are good reviews and demos of the J-60 on YouTube: Just type ""Gibson J-60"" in the search bar...and do read the comments.

In 2013 the J-60 listed for $2,999.00 on Gibson's website:
http://www.gibson.com/Products/Acoustic-Instruments/Square-Shoulder/Gibson-Acoustic/J-60.aspx

Your personal examination of the instrument is welcome, but please note that the price is FIRM. The current fair market value of the J-60 is between $1700-$2300 (depending on its condition). Therefore, the price of $1500 for this 1992 original is already substantially discounted.

For the DT-150 and the DT-155 models produced in June 1983 and later, the serial number format is myypppp where: 

m = month of manufacture (e.g.: A = Jan, B = Feb, ... , K = Nov, L = Dec) 
yy = last two digits of the year of manufacture (e.g.: 83 = 1983) 
pppp = the sequential production number for this individual guitar out of all Ibanez electric guitars manufactured during the specified month/year at a given factory 

Note: pppp is not the total number of guitars manufactured of this model.

[2]	the targeted Market values are assumptions based upon the geographic region or the language of the catalog(s) in which a given model appears. If a model appears in a Japanese language catalog, the Market is assumed to be East. If a model appears in an English language catalog, the Market is assumed to be West.

2018-02-25 15:12:00,"You're looking at an awesome GUITAR RESEARCH T30R TUBE Amplifier! This is for all those guitar players that want that saturated sound of authentic TUBE Amplifiers without breaking the bank! Guitar Research has put together the perfect combination of a 30w Tube amplifier with everything you need.

Comes in a sleek Red Tolex. Features 3 control EQ and also has gain, volume and overdrive. This will play beautiful cleans or scream with crunch tone! Easy to carry lightweight amplifier with handle and rubber feet. If playing any larger gig, just mic up your awesome Tube tone and you're ready to go!

In excellent condition.

These amps have RAVE reviews and are getting very hard to find!

Don't miss your chance to own this awesome amp!

To start, this combo is LOUD! The volume knob goes from 1: almost silent, to 2:jump-out-of-your-seat-with-suprise loud! It has phenominal sound quality; crystal clear and resonsive. And to think it comes out through an unheared of Korean driver is beyond me. It doesn't sound quite like any one Jensen, Celestion, or Eminence speaker I've heared before; it's VERY warm, but not particularly tube-like. It has its own tonal qualities. All three-band equalization knobs (BASS, MIDDLE,TREBLE) work very well and create a wide range tones. The amp's built-in over drive sounds slightly cheesey, but not too bad; I've heard much worse. When the overdrive button is engaged, the previously dialed-in gain essentially doubles, creating more of a distortion, rather than overdrive. The points at which the amp sounds its very warmest are: 1- when the volume is between 4 and 5 and the gain is at ten, and 2- when the volume is between 5 and 6, with the gain at 3 and the over drive engaged. I have tested these settings with both an ES-335 and a '52 reissue Telecaster and the two sound equally awesome. The reverb is great aswell. Using this combo with squeeze-boxes increases versitility of tones greatly. Oweing to the amp's size, it is terrific for rehearsal and recording applications. If you feel you must REALLY tweak the tone, replacing the speaker with a Jensen C12Q would warm up the sound quite a bit, however I think it's fine how it is.

The guitar that set the standard for the travel guitar market, the enduringly popular Baby Taylor makes a great musical companion. Portable, playable and affordable, the Baby features a solid spruce top and yields impressive volume and tone for its compact, three-quarter-size scale. It's the perfect travel mate, it's a great choice for kids taking lessons, and artists from Lindsey Buckingham to Bono to Taylor Swift have used one for songwriting, recording and performing. With its unique dimensions and tonal personality, players have used it in other creative ways, from high-stringing it to setting it up to play lap slide to adding a capo to evoke mandolin-like sounds.

This black  Premier DC is a powerful double-cutaway semi-hollow with standout tone. Driven by a pair of D'Angelico humbuckers, its bold mid-range and glassy high-end provide perfectly balanced output. It comes with cream binding, a maple top, a center block, chrome hardware, chrome tune-o-maticg bridge, signature Stairstep tailpiece for greater resonance, signature aluminum skyscraper truss rod cover, D'Angelico Electrozinc 10's (10-46) strings and Mother of Pearl inlays. The DC's aesthetic is as remarkable as its playability. Equally suited across genres, the Premier DC's tones are as diverse as they are rich. It comes with a new D'Angelico heavily padded gig bag and was just set up by New York's best luthier with an amazingly close action without any buzzing. It was used one time in a video.

Comes with the original case, along with an electronic tuner, a standard 3/4"" audio cable, a lot of guitar picks, and a headphone amp. (plug in your headphones to the audio out for on the go playing!)

From Amazon:

""The Traveler Guitar Ultra-Light is the smallest, lightest full-scale acoustic/electric travel guitar on the market. The proprietary In-Body Tuning System uses standard tuning machines relocated into the body, eliminating the need for a headstock. As a result, you'll have the same full-scale playing experience you're used to on an instrument that's 31 percent shorter and 43 percent lighter than a typical full size acoustic.

You can plug the Ultra-Light into your favorite amp or recording device thanks to its Shadow acoustic piezo pickup and standard 1/4 inch output. The lap rest is detachable for easy transport, so guitar and bag fit easily in an airline overhead compartment. And, since the guitar weighs less than three pounds and is only 28 inches long, you can take it anywhere.

The Traveler Guitar Ultra-Light is the perfect solution for traveling players who want a full-scale experience in the smallest, lightest package possible.""

I still have the vinyl control sticker to put back on it if you'd like - for the photos, I removed it to show you the full trans-blue finish.

Original Hard Shell Case, key, Ernie Ball polish wipes (no polish cloth came with this; you can buy them for $4.00 from Ernie Ball), and original strings. The only thing I did was to switch the original strap buttons for Schaller straplocks, but I used the original screws to do the job. Original strap buttons included, as are the Schaller strap-end locks.

One very nice feature is the active/passive button. Batteries are not even required for playing in passive mode.

It sounds great to play and has had new strings put on recently. There's a few dings on it, and one little chip where I did the bridge work.

It's in mint condition, no dings, no issues. Features a highly flamed koa top (this option is a $600 upcharge from Carvin/Kiesel), incredible sounding piezo (you can blend the pickups with the piezo, have just the piezo on it's own, etc. and it also has two separate inputs if you wanted to split the signal).

This is one of Alvarez's bestselling guitars. The AG75CE is a great all-round instrument for live work or recording. The cedar/rosewood woods create a sophisticated look and the GA body shape is perfect. This Grand Auditorium has the same the scale length (25-1/2"") as their dreadnoughts, but a slightly smaller body with a narrower waist that accentuates the trebles.


The L.R. Baggs StagePro Element is a side-mounted preamp/EQ that offers battery access and a full chromatic tuner that is hidden beneath the control panel to maintain a clean, classy look. The three-band EQ with phase inversion and Garrett Null notch filter controls deliver warm, pristine sound even under the most challenging conditions.

2018-02-24 16:16:00,"I have for sale an excellent NYC-finished 2009 Sadowsky Semi Hollow guitar in the hard-to-find antique blonde finish.  It is in excellent, like-new condition and has no issues. It has only been lightly used and played in my home.

It comes with its original HSC, also in excellent condition, as well as all its other original parts such as its truss rod wrench and stock pick guard which are stored in the case.

To the best of my knowledge from a direct contact with Roger, this is one of the last of the Semi Hollows to be finished in nitro, however if this is important to you, I suggest that you confirm it with Sadowsky Guitars. All of the newer ones are finished in poly.

I had a solid ebony pick guard custom made by the well-known Long Island luthier/guitar builder, Chris Mirabella, and you will see that in some of the pictures. It is fit to the guitar perfectly, but the idea of it is that it required NO SCREW HOLES IN THE GUITAR as the Sadowsky stock pick guard does. It's attached to the pickup surrounds and can be removed by 4 screws that come from the surrounds themselves. No extra parts, no holes, no hassle.

With the Custom pickguard, the asking price is $3400. The Custom one is the one pictured.

But the Custom pick guard is optional and in case you don't want it, you can take $150 off of my asking price which brings it down to $3250. You still get the stock Sadowsky ebony pickguard (uninstalled).

I will entertain some reasonable offers so get in touch if you want one of the best of the 335 type guitars available for any genre of music.

The Bogner Alchemist 112 combo amp is a modern take on vintage tube amp design. Boasting sparkling, articulate cleans, touch-sensitive leads and a bright and colorful crunch, the Alchemist 112 guitar amp owes its remarkable tonality to a 6L6 class-A/B power section, 5 - 12AX7 preamp tubes and a premium Celestion speaker. The Bogner Alchemist 112 amp owes its timeless appeal to classic innovation, modern ingenuity and some entrancing sonic alchemy. 

The Bogner Alchemist 112 has a 2-channel design. Each channel has its own voice and identity. Beginning clean and fast, featuring an open top-end and tight bottom-end, Channel 1 opens gradually to present simmering blues tones that churn like spirits in a cauldron. Advancing toward saturation, Crunch mode turns up the heat adding the perfect touch of nastiness with added pick response and increased tonal complexity. Channel 2, achieving critical mass, invokes the famous white-hot Bogner gain""creamy, modern and screaming with sustain""offering everything from Brit rock right through to modern metal. Plus, with variable Bright settings, each channel can be customized to match the tone of your guitar and rig.

Featuring a selectable power section, from 40 to 20 watts, the Alchemist 112 amp's sonority quickly transforms to display a very different kind of magic. When switched to 20 watts, the Bogner Alchemist 112 amp undergoes a complete sonic metamorphosis, changing its harmonic complexity and feel to conjure the essence of the legendary Brown sound.

Reverb and Delay, in variable styles and levels, run in parallel, separate from the original signal. The result is a rich, living and breathing, fully realized resonance capable of producing a complete tonal landscape.

Note - it must have gotten a little dry this winter, and as of very recently there is a small crack on the top (see in photos) - my understanding is, very common and easy to fix, doesn't affect playability or sound at all but the price reflects a discount for having to possibly make the repair.  Other than that, a couple of very tiny dings and otherwise in great shape.  Get in touch to see / test / play / buy.

Here's some more about this model:

The Martin OM28-V Vintage Reissue Acoustic Guitar has a silky sweet tone produced by a solid Sitka spruce top combined with narrow-waisted comfort and sumptuous appointments. Solid East Indian rosewood back and sides, bold herringbone top inlay, grained ivoroid binding and heel cap, HD zigzag back purfling, and a black ebony fretboard mark this one as a true luxury instrument. Traditional scalloped 1/4"" bracing, solid mahogany neck, modified V neck shape, traditional open-geared Gotoh nickel tuners with butterbean knobs, and a Corian nut make the guitar authentic and ready for years of serious use. Includes case.

This southpaw guitar was briefly  played a few times indoors but never played ""out"". My friend left it with me when he moved back to Louisiana four years ago. He said I can sell it to return me a favor. It was slightly discounted as a ""scratch/dent"" strat (if I remember correctly) but I really can't see what they were talking about. There's a few very slight imperfections that you wouldn't probably notice; really no big deal.

I think it's a mahogany body and maple neck. I see what looks like the same guitar on the www.ravenwestguitar.com site. Click on electric guitars (all electric guitars seem to be in that designation). Scroll down a little bit and you'll see it.

I'm selling this acoustic guitar that I bought brand new maybe 5 years ago. I recently retired from recording, and I'm moving out of the city later this year, so it's time to unload! I'm in Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn. 

Fender DG-8S Acoustic Guitar
Extras: Original hard case. Set of new John Pearse strings. Picks. Tuner. Cleaning cloth. Capo. String winder. Strap. Leopard print pick guard.
Customizations: I had the action lowered at Sam Ash in Midtown in 2015.

I've been recording with this acoustic for a long time. Sounds great. The extras / case alone have a high value.

Here's a song I recorded with it...

Four more line inputs are provided on TRS connectors. An ADAT optical digital connector (Lightpipe) provides eight additional digital inputs that can also be used with external mic preamps, which I have also done.

I purchased this Martin Dreadnought DXK2 Acoustic Guitar new in 2004 and have been the only owner. Overall condition is excellent. Fantastic playability with no neck issues at all and has the rich, full tone you would expect from a Martin. There is some typical, minor wear for the age but nothing that does not add character. I wrote a couple hundred songs on this baby and recorded with it many times over the years. I would love for it to go to a good home. Comes with Freedom SKB original hardshell case and new strings were put on just a few weeks ago. Avoid the lameness of buying new and get an industry standard at a very reasonable price.

Peavey XXX guitar Amp Head...SEXY GIRL PLATE..

The ULTIMATE tone machine.
As hot as the name implies, the XXX® rips. An amp not for the faint of heart, it comes loaded with practical features such as high-gain input and paralleled speaker outputs. Uses 3 - 12AX7 preamp tubes and 4 - 6L6GC power amp tubes. Power amp section can be converted to use 4 - EL34 tubes.

Delivers an earth-quaking 120W of pure tube power controlled by a master volume pot and independent volume knobs for each of its 3 channels. The Ultra and Crunch channels have gain controls to further assist in taming this beast while achieving killer sound. Tone contour is accomplished through passive controls for Bass, Mid, and Treble on the Clean channel, while the Ultra and Crunch channels use active Bottom, Body, and Hair (lo, mid, hi) controls.

Designed to work equally well into 4-, 8-, or 16-ohm loads, matching this monster to a cabinet is a pleasure, not a pain. Includes footswitchable channel and effects loop, damping switch (tight, medium, loose), and line out with level control. Footswitch included.

Line 6/Bogner Spider Valve 112 Combo Guitar Amp
great tones, models and digital effects PLUS the warmth and power of real tubes

This is a masterful collaboration between legendary German boutique tube 
amp craftsman Reinhold Bogner and the sound-modeling scientists at Line 6!

It fuses the versatility of digital modeling with the performance and feel of a world-class tube amplifier.

The Spider Valve design combines 12AX7 preamp tubes with Line 6's signature modeling front-end, a marriage that allows each part of the sonic equation to deliver what it does best: creamy, cascading distortion and enriched harmonics from the tubes, and 12 of the world's finest amp models and seven stunning effects from the modeling front end. And, of course, perfectly matched 6L6 power tubes driving a Celestion Vintage 30 speaker to deliver unprecedented sonic impact and spatial imaging.

With the simple front-end controls and display, programmable patches and presets are instantly within reach. Tweak your tone even further with the front panel Presence, Drive, Bass, Mid and Treble controls: this is a true-blue tube amp, and it acts like one, responding and delivering all the analog detail, performance and warmth of every amp model and effect.
The Spider Valve 112 features 12 dialed in amp models (channel voices) that deliver a complete tonal range from shimmering clean to insane grind, and allows you to access 7 Smart Control FX (up to 3 simultaneously)--including Tape Echo, Sweep Echo, Standard Delay (all with Tap Tempo) Chorus/Flanger, Phaser, Tremolo and Reverb. The Spider Valve also has a built-in front-panel tuner, 36 user programable channels, over 300 artist created presets, and a POD XLR direct out for studio-direct tone.

This Gibson J-100 Xtra Acoustic/Electric Guitar From 2004 is part of the guitar maker's Gibson Super Jumbo family. The J-100 Xtra engineering is also inspired by the classic SJ-100 that was a favorite of artists in the 1930s. These models are designed with larger bodies to produce a greater range of sound. This six-string machine features a solid and scalloped-braced Sitka spruce top and bubinga on the back and sides. This combination delivers an impressive and warm midrange response as well as a thundering bottom. The Gibson J-100 Xtra comes with a Fishman transducer, promising excellent acoustic amplification. It has an antique natural finish, a maple wood round neck and mustache, and a fingerboard constructed from Indian rosewood. Used by everyone from the Beatles to Led Zeppelin and Cream, the Gibson is a classic machine that delivers folk, country, hard rock, and blues.

2018-02-21 15:49:00,"David Gries is a well-known builder of boutique amps - known for his excellent design and high build quality. This Gries 20 was one of his first models. This particular amp is actually #1, the first Gries 20 David built.

The 20 was David's homage to the venerable Fender Deluxe Reverb amp. With a few very sensible changes and upgrades. First, it's a one channel amp, not two. 20 watts, vs. the 22 watts of the DR. Unlike the DR, the Gries 20 has an excellent master volume, also bias test points on the back panel. It also has a truly superior reverb circuit - equal to or better sounding than the best of the Fender combo reverbs I've heard.

I'm not sure of the year. Probably 2006 or 2007. It's in excellent shape, cosmetically and electronically. There are some light marks on the cabinet. No rips or tears. Inside, it's been fitted with all NOS tubes: a pair of RCA blackplate 6v6, a Sylvania 5AR4 rectifier, Bogen, Mullard, RFT and Tesla preamp tubes. No expense was spared here ... this amp sounds wonderful!! The stock speaker was swapped for an Eminence CRex ceramic (lighter, better). Comes with a slightly oversized padded cover from leCover.

More pix here: https://imgur.com/a/0Y05v

If you appreciate a good deluxe reverb, then you will appreciate this amp. It's rare. I've never seen another one. The MV makes it quite flexible, easy to use in even low volume settings. It's just as tasty in a whole different way when you get to turn it up. Please, no trades.

About HORA Musical Instruments
Since 1951

The city of Reghin, called the city of violins, is synonymous with musical instruments production in Romania. This is because in Reghin there are many companies producing musical instruments, especially bowed ones. The most important of them is HORA. With a tradition of almost 60 years, a turnover of 5 million euros and about 300 workers, HORA is the biggest factory for bowed instruments and guitars in Europe.

HORA was founded in 1951 by the master luthier Roman Boianciuc who built the first violin in Reghin.

Now the factory produces yearly more than 50.000 guitars, 5.000 mandolins, 10.000 violins and 2.500 cellos and double basses.

In the last years, HORA has had more and more success with traditional ethnic instruments like mandolins, mandolas, Irish bouzoukis, cobzas, domras, balalaikas, hammer dulcimers, Appalachian dulcimers, psalteries, cimbaloms, panflutes. There are not many producers of such instruments at a professional standard and HORA found a good market niche for them.

The concern for the environment made HORA use more and more water based lacquers which suit even better not only the traditional instruments but also the guitars and even violins. The finish with this kind of lacquers produces open and powerful sound of the instrument.

The spruce and maple wood is from Romanian Carpathians Mountains seasoned naturally for 5-10 years. Exotic wood like mahogany, indian rosewood, ebony is also used.

HORA distributes its instruments all over the world through distributors and also by retail. 80% from the production goes to well known distributors from U.S.A., Canada, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Sweden, Finland, Israel, Russia, Japan etc.

The musical instruments produced by HORA are quality confirmed by ISO9001 certificates and comply with the demands of a very broad spectrum of customers. They provide support to beginners, are reliable for experienced players and give inspiration to virtuosos.

Buy any guitar over $200.00 from the new Brooklyn Fine Guitars and get $20 off the price of the guitar AND $20 off the 2-lesson plan at nearby Chris Conly Guitar Studio! Normally priced at $170.00/month, the bi-weekly hour lesson plan is available with a new guitar purchase for and additional $150.00. This is a great way to get into playing some guitar! More savings can be had--any guitar over $400.00 will save you $40 off the guitar, and the $20 off the lesson plan, saving you a cool $60.00. 

Brooklyn Fine Guitars is a brand new guitar shop in Gowanus/Carroll Gardens, specializing in Yamaha, Epiphone, Guild, Takamine and Washburn guitars, with several other makes also available. All types of guitars--acoustic, electric, hybrid, classical, basses, and Yamaha amplifiers are also available.

Try it a little bit, dig it a lot, buy it with the 2-lesson plan for a total of $399.99 and save a total of $40 from the price of buying the guitar by itself, then waiting, playing some, possibly getting frustrated, then finding Chris Conly Guitar Studio and signing up for the lesson plan. Great motivation to get learning and playing on a great instrument!

2018-02-28 08:27:00,"Here is a very cool and rare Danelectro guitar from 1961. 

The good:
The coolest most vibey vintage guitar you can find without taking out a second mortgage!
From what I can tell the guitar is all original including its chipboard case.
The master volume knob dates to the 38th week of 1961 and the concentric knobs I can not read well enough to date them but I believe are original. 
The guitar plays great and stays in tune well with good action and a straight neck. 
Two of the three concentric volume control knobs appear to be original and I have placed a third on their from a 90's reissue Dano. 

The not so good:
Somehow someway the logo on the headstock decided to separate from this guitar but you can still see where the finish aged around it, which is pretty cool in my opinion. I will include a replacement decal with a decal solution however if you don't find it as cool as I do.
There is a small crack in the body where the neck and the body join together but I don't think it is anything to be worried about. The case of the middle position lipstick pickup is splitting on the top half but that is easily replaced or can just be left as it has no effect on the sound. 
The guitar is also missing the ""chicken head"" type knobs/switches that are used to turn on and off each pick up but that can still be done with easy without them. 
The guitar also appears to have had a floating tail piece or maybe even a bigsby at some point with some speed holes drilled in near the strap button around the base of the guitar. 
The middle pick up volume knob can be kind of finicky on occasion but also is something that is fine 99% of the time. 
There are also various dings around the body that you would expect with a guitar that's 56 years old 

This is a truly fantastic and rare guitar that you can get for a fraction of what they go for in mint condition, don't let this one get away!

If you're a Mike Campbell fan, or have lusted after an early 1950s Broadcaster or Nocaster but haven't won the lottery yet, this meticulous Fender Broadcaster reproduction by luthier John Scott of Nashville's Bluesman Vintage, is your answer.

This is the best Telecaster I have ever played. It is super resonant when played unplugged; literally vibrates your chest. Just amazing. This is an awesome Bluesman Vintage T-style modeled after Mike Campbell's 1950's Broadcaster. 

The guitar is very lightweight, in the low 6 lbs range, and really rings. Killer grain on the well-distressed swamp ash body. Compound radius 7.25-9.5 birds eye maple neck. 6150 frets. Glendale bridge and saddles. And last, but certainly not least, Nunley Custom Pickups wound just like Mr. Campbell's Rock machine. If you love killer tone, you will love this!

This is as close as you are going to get to a '50s Broadcaster without shelling out $9,000 to $10,000 on the Mike Campbell Custom Shop Nocaster (only 25 made, good luck) or ponying up $35K for a real one.

Neck Width: at nut 1.687"", 12th 2.02"", 21st 2.19""
Neck Thickness: .975"" at nut, 1.00"" at 12th
Neck Carve: Nice and full C, if not U shaped.

From the web:
Fat synth sounds and effects in a compact pedal for GK-equipped guitars
Provides 6 synth-type waves and effects--Saw Lead, Square, Ring Mod, Slow Gear, Sitar and Acoustic
11 chorus and delay effects, plus Color and Level knobs for further tweaking

Onboard Modulation and Delay Effects

In true vintage fashion, the WP-20G provides 11 different kinds of chorus and delay, which can be turned on and off using one of the two built-in pedals. These effects are great for modulation and doubling, while additional tonal control is provided by a Color knob. And with the WP-20G's Level knob, you can blend dry guitar with the effected sound to your liking.

The absolute most reliable power amp I've ever used, and it doesn't really color the sound, and I've compared it to other power amps and it gives the best sound, I genuinely don't understand exactly how it is this good. 1u and 3 channels of 500 watts each. There was a short point where I ran 2 separate guitars and a bass rig through this, and it handled all 3 without any signs of slowing. Easily my favorite brand of power amp. - $700
Rocktron Midi Mate I'll be honest I haven't been gentle with this, it's not in great condition and I've tried everything to get the residue from previous stickers off and I can't get it off. Maybe some goo-gone would work. It still works perfectly but it just isn't as pretty as it was new. I enjoyed using it, and glowing in the dark is such a useful feature. - $100

$2300 individually, I'd honestly rather sell it all together for $2000.

All the cables are included and there's actually a couple extras. I'm happy to answer any kind of questions regarding this, I can't recommend this kind of rig enough. Perfect for guitar, bass, live usage, home practice, amateur and professional recording. There isn't anything that I've been able to say it's bad at. I've run 2 guitars through the axe fx, a guitar and a bass through the axe fx, changing patches with different setups, I genuinely can't think of any issues with any of it. 

I'm located in Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn but I work an Manhattan and I could probably deliver this anywhere reasonable. I'm not open to shipping, considering the nature of these things. If you need a rack case, I could probably also sell a 6u rack case.

(https://reverb.com/item/9952951-gibson-es-330-tdc-1965-cherry-wide-nut-original-bigsby?publish_confirmation=true).
Can also check my feedback......

1965 Gibson ES-330 TDC in original cherry finish with a factory bigsby. Has full 1-11/16 nut width and nickel parts! This guitar is all original except for a refret and brand new nylon saddles, the very torn up originals are included. It was done really well. It certainly has some dings, wear, character. I have pictured the larger dings and tried to capture the finish checking as well as possible (its mostly on the back of the neck). There are no structural cracks on this guitar and no major repairs found. The truss rod works well. The serial number dates to the beginning of the 65-67 numbers and because this has nickel parts and a wide nut it would mean early 65. 

Minor Issues:
-One bent tuning button (still works 100%)
-Refretted and has minor fretwear on first few frets (Does not effect playability and nothing a crowning wouldn't completely take care of, not that its needed)
-Finish checking
-Headstock edge wear (no breaks or cracks)
-tarnishing of the nickel parts
-little warping of pickguard
-Various little dings in body

The pictures at the end of the pickups are before I cleaned them.

This guitar has certainly been played and its for a reason, it plays and sounds great. Comes with original hard shell case and is a little worn, but the inside is perfect and all the latches work.

The Speaker

...so was called the first practical guitar amplifier in catalogs. The wooden case pictured with the ""frying pan"" of the early years sported probably a more complete circuit. It is said to have been designed by C.W. Lane, one of Electro Strings stockholders, and built by the Van Nest radio shop in L.A. The case was provided by Johnson Cabinet Works, which made it out of plywood covered with Keratol. The very first models had no metal corners, nor did it feature the ""Rickenbacher"" logo. These came the following year. In 1932, three versions were sold which could accomodate up to three instruments (respectively $62.50, $65 and $70).

I've owned this for 17 years. It's a great blues amplifier - really looks cool on stage as you play slide guitar or strum an old semi. Instant Robert Johnson! Ships to the lower 48 for $65 Fedex Insured.

for auction is the groundbreaking new product from Aspen Pittman
Designs, The DuoTonic guitar tone pedal.The DuoTonic Overdrive is an innovative tube-based preamp/overdrive/boost pedal.

Aspen Pittman Design's newest design for the guitarist combines a
classically voiced ""two pentode"" all tube high gain channel that has a
full range of tone and timbre controls, as well as two vintage inspired
SS overdrive circuits. Dual OD options driving dual tube gain channel
provides a Duo Tonic for reviving your tone!


Description:

Designed by two giants of modern tube technology - Aspen Pittman of Groove Tubes and Mark Samson - the Duo Tonic Overdrive allows guitarists to get a true cranked-tube sound in any situation, at any volume.

The Duo Tonic Overdrive pedal features top-quality
components inside. The only way to get real tube sound is to use real
tubes, and driving the tube channel you'll find a genuine pair of
military-spec 6205 pentode tubes. And the overdrive/boost side of the
pedal gives you classic mid-hump drive tones thanks to the JRC4558 chip.
You'll get incredible touch sensitivity and that authentic drive that's
been used to push tube amps for decades.

The Duo Tonic Overdrive is designed to feed its solid
state overdrive side into the tube section. This is both is the key to
its sonic diversity and what gives it the ability to emulate the sound
of a tube amp getting pushed hard. The solid state side can be used to
nudge a tube amp toward saturation. Or you can use the tube section like
a new channel on your amplifier, all the while having a separate
JRC4558 based overdrive to push any of your tones into crunchier
territory. Better yet, use both sides together and let the distortion
run wild!

Features:
Designed to give cranked tube amp tones, pushed by an overdrive pedal
Two independent channels (tube and overdrive/boost)
Contains military-spec 6502 pentode tubes
Overdrive/boost section makes the pedal incredibly touch-sensitive

2018-02-27 17:22:00,"Hi everyone, 

I am opening up my electronic music production studio. I have built up a pretty sweet setup in my Brooklyn apartment, and I thought I'd see if people might be interested in sharing it sometimes. 

Maybe you are a producer who works mainly with soft synths, and wants to replace them with vintage analogue hardware? Maybe you want to jam out with some of these old machines and record a bunch of stuff that you can then edit and arrange in your own time? Maybe you want to try out a specific piece of hardware? Maybe you want someone to help you with some of the technical aspects of the production process? Or learn how to work with Ableton or Logic? Or something else ...? 

I am starting this off at the (really pretty low) price of $25 per hour. So if you want to come by and make some cool-sounding music, message me ;)

I'm also open to setting up a more long-standing arrangement with someone who is looking for a regular space to make music in, so get in touch if that sounds interesting to you.

Thanks for reading, 
Conor

Gear list:
ARP 2600: The most versatile and glorious-sounding 3-oscillator mono synth of all (IMHO). From delicate, flute-like leads to dubstep basses of unimaginable heaviness , the Arp can do pretty much anything. And running other synths or drum machines through its filters, VCA and spring reverb makes even the most sterile soft synth sound vibey. It makes an amazing guitar processor too; and interfaces perfectly with the Eurorack system so you can sequence it with the Metropolis, add extra oscillators or modulation etc. It's a lot of fun to hook up the Euro joystick to a couple of parameters and jam out. From the computer, I sequence it via Expert Sleepers Silent Way and ES3, which gives 8 perfectly calibrated octaves and tight timing. 

Roland Jupiter 4: Desert-island polysynth from 1978. Probably the most musical synth in the bunch -it always sounds gorgeous. Clock the arpeggiator from an external source (such as the 606 or the computer) and take off on a voyage into blissful cosmic disco. Or solo the suboscillator for a perfect Mr. Fingers square wave bass tone. Or crank up the LFO into audio rate and crate raw (yet still crazy musical) sound effects. The snappiest envelopes, the most alive-sounding oscillators, the coolest portamento. Just completely overhauled and sounding fantastic (and perfectly in tune!)

Moog Source: For my money, an equal to the Mini: more focused sound, more stable tuning, and presets! When you listen to the bottom octave of this synth against any modern synth you hear the quality: the deepest notes make most modern analogs sound mushy and unmusical --with the Source, you still really hear the note no matter how low you go. In a different league to any of the newer Moogs in this regard. It also has a sparkly high end that sits really well in the mix. I usually sequence it via Silent Way, which gives precise tuning over 8 octaves. 

Yamaha CS-60: A beautiful, deeply musical synth. Almost impossible to make it sound bad. Blade Runner-esque warbling leads and brass are a cinch, and the ring mod adds a fantastic bite to it. Layer it up and add a little chorus and it's indistinguishable from the venerated CS-80. (just tuned!)

Roland SH-2: An underrated killer: if you want a bass sound that has a chunky, percussive tone, plenty of low-end heft, and still sits in the mix without ridiculous amounts of EQ, the SH-2 provides that by the bucketful. Really good for fast 16th-note basslines; also does a fine line in wiggly portamento leads.

Akai MPC-3000: The drum and sequencing heart of many hip hop setups (J. Dilla, Dre) as well as many house heads. The sound is 3D and snappy, with a touch of grit, and the timing of the sequencer is extremely tight. This one has newly-replaced chunky pads, and a CF card reader for easy transferring of samples from the computer. Email me some samples and I'll load them on the MPC in advance.

Yocto 808 clone. A part for part, discrete, through-hole replication of Roland's venerable drum machine. Sounds indistinguishable to my ears.

Roland TR-606: Classic little drum box. The high hats are unbeatable. This one also has a mod that lets you trigger the hats from other CV sequencers.

E-Mu E6400 Ultra: Not too many people use these any more, but it KILLS any soft sampler in terms of sonics. Every sound you put into this thing comes out more hi-fi and punchy. The sound of late 90s drum and bass.

Ensoniq ESQ-1: Digital waves through Curtis analog filters. Great for lush pads or lofi early digital sounds. Lots of crunch.

Eurorack rig: Highlights include the ever-funky Intellijel Metropolis sequencer, the Plonk percussive modeler, Analog Systems oscillators (as used by James Holden, Radiohead), the SID guts chiptune oscillator, dual Ensoniq Mirage filters (feat. original chips), Jupiter 6 filter, low pass gate, wavefolders, phasers, flangers, distortion, Juno 106 chorus (also feat. rare chips), dual joysticks, clock dividers, Euclidean generators, the list goes on... 
It interfaces really well with the computer via Expert Sleepers Silent Way software and their ES3 module, which give perfect tuning over 8 octaves, tempo-synced LFOs and timing that is tighter than midi.

RE-303: A part-for-part clone of the Roland 303, with some modern tweaks. Aciieeed!

Modor NF-1m: New school digital synth, loads of personality. I'm constantly getting inspirational sounds out of this thing. 

Elektron Digitakt: fantastic new sampler/drum box from Elektron. Great for mangling samples. 

Mutable Instruments Ambika: 6 voices of digital waveforms through SMR-4 (Roland-esque) analog filters. Great pad machine, and can do a lot more, including Waldorf-esque wavetable sounds. 

PreenFM2: Covering the FM bases, this is a versatile FM synth with a few extra tricks up its sleeve (bit crusher! filters!). 

Software:
Newest versions of Ableton (and a Push 2) and Logic; Pro Tools 11.

Monitors:
Focal Solo 6Be and subwoofer. Accurate, and plenty of low end.

Allen and Heath Zed R16 desk: excellent and versatile board, with plenty of headroom. Good for external summing or doing all-hardware jams.

Converters: MOTU 16A. The newest generation of MOTU interfaces mark a real step up from previous ones: this thing has 124db of dynamic range and the same converter chips as the Apogee Ensemble. Compares favorably to the UAD Apollo in my estimation. 16 ins and outs.

Outboard:

Preamps: As well as the ones in the desk, I have a pair of hand-built API clones from Classic API: all discrete, through hole construction with custom transformers. They really add presence and can be overdriven for nice saturation. I have a Neve-style pre on the way also.

Compressors: CAPI FC526-XFMR: all-discrete compressor pair, can go from transparent to very grabby and lively.

EQ:  2 channels of Kush Electras, a very sweet-sounding EQ. Boosting on these sounds a lot better than any plugin I have tried.

A-Designs REDDI V2 dual tube DI box: the best DI box in the game. Insane headroom, phenomenal low-end response. This thing weighs a ton -it's got pentode vacuum tubes and giant Carnhill transformers for each channel. Warms up digital sounds, helps bass sit nicely in the mix. 

OTO Machines BAM reverb: boutique, seventies-style reverb in the EMT style. Works really well on a lot of synth sounds.

Empress Echosystem delay: really versatile double delay that can pretty much do anything you want from it.

Meris Polymoon delay: makes everything sound like you have taken loads of drugs. Use this for ""instant Blade Runner"", as someone said. 

Esoniq Dp/4: early 90s multieffects with lots of character, famously the ""Daft Punk phaser"". Used a lot by those French dudes. Also great for vibey reverbs and delays.

Golden Age Comp2A: LA2A clone (a vintage tube compressor). Just makes everything sound nicer, and can distort in a sweet way when you crank the input gain all the way. I've replaced the stock tubes with RCA ones from 1957, sounds really vibey.

Overstayer stereo SSL bus compressor clone: glues the mix together very nicely. I usually run it straight into...

Pultec EQ clone x 2: Klark Teknik tube EQs; these sweeten the mix really nicely or can be used on individual sounds. 

2 x Technics SL-1200 M3D turntables with brand new tonearms, rewired with litz and Mogami cables, and Shure audiophile cart. Allen and Heath mixer. Hundreds of records to sample too!

Left and Right power amps can be switched to Main/Monitor driving both main speakers and floor monitors. With this much power, the XP800L can cover audiences up to 300 people. The high efficiency ""Green"" Class D power amplifiers conserve power so they are more environmentally friendly and cheaper to operate. Two 1/4-inch speaker connectors are featured on the front panel for fast set up. 

SUPERB SOUND is derived from the extremely low distortion, ""high headroom"" design. State-of-the art, low noise, balanced XLR preamps from our Concert Series mixers provide common mode rejection better than 78 dB, which means that any noise that may come over your cables is virtually eliminated. Distortion is nearly non-existent with THD below 0.1% from input to output, guaranteeing the purity of your sound. Hear the difference. 

LIGHTWEIGHT/EASY TO USE Controls are logically laid out making the XP Series simple to use reducing errors during setup and performance. Its compact size and weight of only 10 lbs. makes it the lightest, most powerful mixer in its class. 

2 HIGH CURRENT ""GREEN"" CLASS-D AMPLIFIERS each produce 250w RMS, 325w peak at 4 ohms or 140w RMS, 210w peak at 8 ohms. Class D amps not only run cooler, but their power efficiency is outstanding. This means they demand less power from the wall to sustain the power needed to drive your speakers. Speaker outputs accept standard 1/4""connectors for secure connections. 

HIGH CURRENT ""GREEN"" SWITCHMODE POWER SUPPLY conserves power by operating at higher efficiency. The DC voltage supply is recharged 100,000 times per second, delivering continuous high current to the power amps. 

24-BIT STEREO DSP EFFECTS allow you to assign your channels to your choice of effects. The effects are adjustable to your stage monitors so you can hear yourself with full effects. The effects processor with 256 effects includes reverbs, choruses, flanging and echoes with fully adjustable parameters for damping, decay, depth, speed, regeneration and time. 

ACTIVE 3 BAND CHANNEL EQ provides easy adjustment for the tone you want. The 80Hz LO frequency control delivers a solid non-flabby bass. A simple adjustment with the MID band control brings out the best sound for vocals or guitar by affecting the very important 750Hz frequency range. The 11.5k Hz HI treble control adds sparkle to your top-end without adding harshness. Both the LO and HI controls are ""shelving"", which means they are effective from 20Hz to 20kHz. 

STEREO 7-BAND EQUALIZER provide precise adjustments to fine tune your overall sound and to help control feedback. The EQ tracks with the main power amps either to the LR main outputs or monitor/main outputs (mono). 


USB Panel Light
ENGINEERED TO LAST Every XP Series mixer incorporates a rugged steel chassis with protective side panels. Continuous full power is assured from high-grade 6063-T5-aluminum heat sinks. Sealed controls and switches guard against the outside elements while heavy-duty connectors provide a positive connection to your cables. Hidden deep in the heart of these mixers is the ""SMT"" Surface Mount Technology that utilizes surface mounted components to prevent parts from shaking or vibrating loose. Precision 1% tolerances guarantee your settings will be accurate every time. Fire retardant FR-4 military spec circuit cards feature double-sided copper to guard against noise and radio frequencies (RF). The XP Series is made in the USA for years of dependable service.

I'm moving to an apartment with less wall space to have to thin out my collection.

Speller was an African-American artist born in the Delta country of central Mississippi. Raised by hismaternal grandmother, Speller dropped out of school at the age of twelve.Speller grew up working on Delta farms, where eventually  began to draw.   Speller was anaccomplished blues musician who played guitar with such legends as Howlin' Wolfand Muddy Waters. Speller was discoveredin the early 1980s.   He wasrepresented by the Luise Ross gallery in New York City. Works by Speller are included in museumcollections including the High Museum in Atlanta and the Smithsonian inWashington, DC.

Speller's colorful  drawings were inspired by scenes from his own life such asriverboats, animals, and human figures.  He is best known for his  drawings of long-legged men and womenwearing patterned clothing who he called characters from (the televisionseries)  Dallas.  He would draw on large 19 by 20 inch sheets ofpaper, outlining his subjects with a graphite pencil and filling in with crayonand colored pencils. 

This drawing is not signed as many of the early folk art  paintings by Speller.

East Indian Rosewood - I think they call it Monkey Pod - has a sound that is hard to
describe in words - but when you hear it - it will be unlike other woods. It responds and
resonates in a way other woods do not. It is based on the G&L Invader
type - but that's just a name they had to give it. This guitar is all original
other than upgaded pickups. Neck and body info is in one of the photos I posted.
It is a very rare piece - as the supply of East Indian wood was either very limited or cannot be

It stays in tune for days and has all the tones you could wish for.

 OVERVIEW

Solid mahogany for tone to please the ear, and quilted maple to please the eye.

Premiere bass tone can now be yours thanks to the Ibanez SRA500 bass guitar. Its body is mahogany with a quilted maple top to give it a luxurious appearance. The 3-piece bolt-on maple neck enhances resonance and attack, while its U-shaped profile and 12"" fretboard radius make it especially fretting-hand friendly. EMG pickups have a dual-coil design for low noise and plenty of output. They have the punch and fullness of older passive designs along with added brightness for a better-defined tone. A Ibanez bass's 3-band EQ offers ample tone tweaking capability, while cosmo black hardware and a gloss finish create a slick look.

2018-02-27 12:40:00,"The KXR 100 is actually much more than a keyboard amp. With its heavy-duty Fender Special Design speaker and dual piezo-electric horn, it could actually be classified as a self-contained portable PA. system, suitable for almost any musical instrument requiring full-range reinforcement, such as electronic keyboards, acoustic/electric guitar, electric violin, or voice. The KXR 100 is capable of serving as a bass amp, a P.A system, or a guitar amp that is capable of handling the power and raunchiness of an electric guitar, while also being able to reproduce the delicate overtones of an acoustic guitar. Thus, the name ""Full-Range Amplifier.""
Transparent amps are made with few effects and distortions.  Designed as a keyboard amp, the KXR is just that.  It offers a clear sound for keyboards, can be used for vocals or acoustics with terrific clarity, but also allows for the raunchiness of electric guitar or a bass. Three channels make this a virtual pa system! $250  Call  show contact info

Designed for use with a guitar rig but also works well with DJ setup, hands scratching/fading while your feet make magic. Does not have MIDI over USB.

Cycle through the signal chains of 100 of today's top guitarists with the Zoom G5n. This next-generation modeler faithfully re-creates five celebrated tube amps, five speaker cabinet impulses, and 68 effects in stunning 24-bit quality for a virtually unlimited number of tweakable tone options, and comes loaded with presets from the guitarists of Smashing Pumpkins, Joss Stone, Korn, and Stevie Wonder (etc.) for instant inspiration. Modeled tones can be sent out to an amp and enhanced with real speaker dynamics, sent direct to a PA to keep stage volumes quiet, or recorded direct into the computer via USB for zero-latency, no-fuss studio tones. The Zoom G5n's onboard 80-second stereo looper and tuner make this board an excellent value for solo artists and live performers, and a stereo headphone out makes it a useful tool for practicing at home, at work, or out on the road.





Zoom G5n Multi-effects Pedal at a Glance:
Faithfully models five tube amps, five cabs, and 68 classic effects for endless options
Includes 100+ artist presets for instant inspiration
Onboard stereo looper and tuner for solo performers
USB interface full of studio-ready guitar tones
Faithfully models five tube amps, five cabs, and 68 classic effects for endless options
Guitarists who have dreamed of owning a studio full of great guitar gear or taking a backline of amps out on the road will love the flexibility of the G5n. This pedal lets you choose head and speaker impulses to approximate up to 25 different amp combinations - like tweed 2 x 12"" combos, British half-stacks, or American high-gain combos - and tweak them in real time. Further color your sound with 24-bit reverb, overdrive, phaser, and many other onboard FX - up to nine at once. Then save up to 200 patches to lock in your settings for stage and studio use. No big deal if you forget to write a patch - the G5n's autosave feature has your back.

Includes 100+ artist presets for instant inspiration
Crank out great tones right out of the box with over 100 artist presets from the guitarists of Smashing Pumpkins, Shudder to Think, Aaron Neville, and more. A growing online library ensures that you'll always have fresh inspiration at your fingertips.

Onboard stereo looper and tuner for solo performers
A built-in 80 sec looper makes the G5n an exceptional value for acoustic players and solo artists. Experiment with different rhythms, melodies, leads, and chord shapes in practice. Then take your riffs to the stage and impress your audience. Staying in tune between songs is easy with a discreet onboard tuner.

USB interface full of studio-ready guitar tones
Zoom had Sweetwater guitarists salivating over the G5n's no-fuss recording interface. Mac and Windows users can plug the G5n directly into a computer via USB and capture their best tones on tape with zero-latency monitoring. This is a cost-effective option for guitarists who don't have access to world-class amps, mics, and preamps, or who share walls with neighbors and can't crank up to recording-worthy levels.

Zoom G5n Multi-effects Pedal Features:
Powerful amp modeler and multi-FX unit
Mix and match 5 tube amps and 5 speaker cab impulses
Choose between 2 virtual dynamic microphones
100 artist presets for instant inspiration
200 user presets to save a set's worth of sounds
Hardware knobs for real-time tweaking
68 digital FX including reverb, chorus, flanger, and overdrive to color your sound

2018-02-27 10:41:00,"The Pro Tone Series. Guitarist, players to pros, have shouted the praises of these guitars since their inception. They were made so well that the story is Fender pulled the line because they were made too good and taking away sales from the American made line.

I am certainly a fan of the Pro Tone Series. These guitars have an exceptional feel and quality that most guitars can't touch. The necks are precise, excellent fret work as well as quality made bodies. The pickups sound amazing with full, rich clean tones. This guitar could go up against any American made Fender guitar anytime, any day.
 Its a beautiful guitar with a fantastic top with nice grain. That great tele tone! This is whole lot of guitar for the price. Trust me you will not be disappointed.

In 2014, Fender celebrates the diamond jubilee of arguably the world's greatest electric guitar with the limited-edition 60th Anniversary American Vintage 1954 Stratocaster. This special guitar honors the Stratocaster's very first model year as an exciting new instrument with a tone as new and different as tomorrow, and is reverently crafted with a rich selection of features, appointments and accessories.

The two-piece ash body features a sideseam and a flash-coat lacquer finish in the guitar's original two-color Sunburst. The one-piece maple neck has a comfortable 1954 profile and date stamp just below the truss rod adjustment nut, topped by a 7.25""-radius fingerboard with rolled edges and 21 vintage frets. Three modern 1954 single-coil Stratocaster pickups deliver a singing original-era voice, with five-way switching complemented by an included optional three-way switch for original wiring. The guitar also features a single-ply white pickguard and white polystyrene control knobs, bone nut and round string tree, American Vintage synchronized tremolo bridge with six special saddles, vintage tuners and nickel-chrome hardware.

Special extras and accessories include a vintage-design single-stitch center-pocket tweed case; replica polishing cloth, cable, black leather strap and bridge cover; extra tremolo springs (two), and reproduction 1954 paperwork. 

Available in a limited edition of 1,954 guitars, each of which comes with a special 1954 Anniversary Strat Certificate.

NICR OPEN BAND. Excellent bike to learn to ride or wheelie or 

commute around town retro style. Serious inquires only. No low 

ballers I KNOW WHAT I HAVE AND ITS WORTH!
Honda z50 in great running condition
Small tear on seat but nothing crazy 
Well maintained
Starts right up 
Nothing wrong with it mechanically just regular wear and tear 

from using it
Bought it from a friend a few months ago thinking I could use it 

as a pitbike but it's a little small for me and I get a leg cramp 

when I ride it so I need something a little bigger but the bike 

starts right up first kick unless it's freezing out then it might 

take a few and it's got some real good power for its size 
Will trade for an 85 or kx100 I can add cash if needed

Like new P-255 Yamaha digital piano. Includes fold up stand 

and bench. Call Don to check it out. from website:
Yamaha's P-Series is a bestseller in the field of compact, stylish 

digital pianos. The Yamaha P-255 is the flagship model that 

offers a more authentic piano sound and feel than ever before. 

Thanks to its highly portable design, this digital piano can be 

played in any place or setting you desire. The P-255 can be 

attached to its attractive furniture stand at home, and then 

easily taken to a gig or rehearsal for use with or without its 

internal speakers. In addition, the new P-255 Controller App 

for iOS is an out-of-this-world touchscreen interface that 

offers unprecedented control for a digital piano in this price 

range. White Finish
DOD FX-12 Tuna Tuner - $25 OBO

Standard pedal tuner - it's in surprisingly good shape 

considering the age. Tracks well for guitar and solid for bass - 

a tiny delay on E for bass, but it does the job. Has two outputs 

so you can choose between muting when you engage for 

tuning, or use the bypass output so it's always on. Also, the 

grilled tuna paint job is pretty classy if you want to add some 

meat to your pedal-board...

Zoom 506II Bass Multi-Effects Unit - $50 OBO

This thing is still in excellent shape. Includes: Tuner, 

Compressor/Limiter, Auto-Wah, 12 Distortion Modules w/ 

adjustable gain, EQ, Amp Modeler, Reverb/Delay, and 9 types 

of modulation (chorus, octave, wah, synth, defret, etc). The 

effects are stackable, with a patch level setting to even out 

volume once dialed in. I used some of the envelope filters, the 

delay, and the chorus quite a bit. The octaver is also 

surprisingly good. Overall, not in the realm of the $300 plus 

units out there, but a nice pedal for the price.

Not using these right now, just need to clear some space. Only 

trade interest would be a Wren & Cuff Tall Font Russian or 

Pickle Pie Bass Hella Fuzz.
For sale is a used twice Ultimate keyboard stand.
This is a generic spider capo - They're ALL made in china. With 

this capo the only limit to your open tunings is your 

imagination. It's a bit hard to turn the levers on this one, but it 

doesn't cost $24-36 bucks either. Good for experimentation.

2018-02-27 07:58:00,"Hi All,
Selling my 2006 Epi Les Paul electric guitar. I'm the second owner. I played it a lot and it's still amazing. Also it is the most beautiful of all LP's out there. If you have 3,200$ for a Gibson - You're lucky. If not - you might want to consider this one. A gorgeous orange-to- red burst with unbelievable flamed top. The pictures really don't show it well. (search images for Heritage Cherry).  This is the Custom model (as opposed to Standard or Studio etc.) with the double binding, rectangle inlays (1st fret as well!) Grover tuners, Gold hardware and some more custom features. It is so comfortable to play, and the sustain seems to last forever (maybe i'm exaggerating a bit).
Original price was 700. I paid 550 (it was almost as new). I Put a 59' Seymour Duncan in the neck position. It is a beast.
There are some nicks and small scratches. Nothing major.
Comes in a SKB hard case (Made in California) - the outside is a little worn but the inside is just fine.
I also have some pedals and extra stuff that I would like to sell (see pic)- if interested in something specific there- let me know.
Price is pretty firm.
Cash only and local pickup - No Shipping. The guitar is in downtown Jersey City but I drive in NJ a lot and I'm in the city a lot so we can figure something out.
Thanks!

2018-02-27 03:47:00,"FELA ! Original Off-Broadway Poster NYC 2' x 3' Rare 2008 in Mint New Condition and Rolled. 

Large Color Poster for the very first Original New York City 2008 Stage Production of * FELA ! * Off-Broadway near Times Square at the acclaimed 37 Arts Theater on West 37th Street in Hell's Kitchen , New York City. The life and music of the extraordinarily talented Nigerian song writer and freedom fighter Fela Kuti lands in New York City Off-Broadway. In this new musical, directed and choreographed by Tony Award winner Bill T. Jones with a book by Jim Lewis and arrangements by Aaron Johnson and Antibalas, audiences are welcomed into the extravagant, decadent and rebellious world of Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti. Using his pioneering music (a blend of jazz, funk and African rhythm and harmonies), Fela! explores Kuti's controversial life as artist, political activist and revolutionary musician. Featuring many of Fela Kuti's most captivating songs and Bill T. Jones's imaginative staging, this new show is a provocative hybrid of concert, dance and musical theater.The musical style performed by Fela Kuti is called Afrobeat, which is essentially a fusion of jazz, funk and Traditional African Chant. It is characterized by having African style percussion, vocals, and musical structure, along with jazzy, funky horn sections. The ""endless groove"" is also used, in which a base rhythm of drums, muted guitar, and bass guitar are repeated throughout the song. This is a common technique in African and African-influenced musical styles, and can be seen in funk and hip-hop. Some elements often present in Fela's music are the call-and-response with the chorus and figurative but simple lyrics. Fela's songs were almost always over ten minutes in length, some reaching the twenty or even thirty minute marks. This was one of many reasons that his music never reached a substantial degree of popularity outside of Africa. His songs were mostly sung in Nigerian pidgin, although he also performed a few songs in the Yoruba language. Fela's main instruments were the saxophone and the keyboards but he also played the trumpet, guitar and made the occasional drum solo. Fela refused to perform songs again after he had already recorded them, which also hindered his popularity outside Africa. Fela was known for his showmanship, and his concerts were often quite outlandish and wild. He referred to his stage act as his ""underground spiritual game"". For a excellent video preview of this wonderful unique musical , check out this link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB0GepZMzKU . 

         This rare Original Poster is Large Wall Size ( measures 2' foot wide by 3' foot high ) and is printed on thick heavy chrome-coat advertising poster stock paper printed in Beautiful Brilliant , Razor-sharp 6 color production. This Original FELA ! Poster is printed in Limited Edition and features both beautiful musical graphics and saturated colors, as well as a great photograph of Fela. Rare , Authentic , FELA !

show contact info


The 2016 Les Paul Studio T is ideal for the serious guitarist who wants a great performer, but needs to stay within budget. This year's model is available with a carved maple top over a weight-relieved mahogany body in a wide selection of cool colors, all in a thin, high-gloss nitrocellulose lacquer finish. The exclusive finishing process is labor intensive and isn't just about looks, but helps define this model's exceptional tone.

The neck features Gibson's traditional nut width that players love and a thicker, one-piece rosewood fingerboard that offers better feel and sustain. All Les Paul models this year come with a self-lubricating Graph Tech nut that helps in tuning and lets strings return to pitch following heavy string bending. Electronics feature Gibson' popular 490R and 498T humbuckers with alnico magnets for rich, singing tones in all positions.

Traditional manual tuners add a vintage vibe while providing smooth and efficient performance. Set up at the factory by experts, the 2016 Les Paul Studio T is ready for immediate action and comes in a traditional brown hardshell case.

Key features:
Smooth, efficient performance and a vintage vibe
Original neck dimensions from the Les Paul that launched a thousand hits
Density for solid sustain, self-lubrication for accurate return-to-pitch - even with heavy string bending
The look and feel you know and love
The original Les Paul case style, now with enhanced protection
Combines legendary resonance and sustain with greater playing comfort
Alnico magnets give rich, singing tones in both the neck (490R) and hotter bridge (498T) positions
Traditional appearance and seminal sustain in a solid, one-piece design
Expert setup makes this handcrafted, American-made guitar ready for immediate action
Exclusive labor-intensive finishing process isn't just about look and feel, but superior tone

i'm moving out to LA this month, so i'm selling a bunch of my musical equipment to help pay for the trek. 
i've had this guitar for about six years, and it sounds great!
i've replaced the original jaguar bridge for a mastery bridge (deeper saddles and adjustable height to help keep the strings in place), added strap locks, and flipped the pickup switches upside down so you don't accidentally switch them off while strumming. i've also kept the original stock pickups, and they sound great. 
there are just a few dings on the body from usual wear over the years, seen in the pics. 

the hard shell case is included, along with a whammy bar and the strap w/ locks.

Clean Boost

The Hotone LIFTUP Clean Boost stompbox is the perfect way to raise your volume while maintaining the original sound of your guitar.
Use the TONE control to shape your ideal clean boost, and try the WARM function button to further construct your own VOLUME UP solution.
This pedal was designed with two principles in mind: ""Keep the signal super clean"", and ""Lots of tone shaping capability"".
It can volume up the signal without any distortion: the secret weapon of getting a transparent tone with great dynamic expression.

Really nice flamed top, nice patina on the hardware and binding, all electronics are original. Guitar plays great and functions perfectly all around.

Not cosmetically perfect, one knob was replaced with a non matching black knob, but should be easy enough to replace. And there is a repaired headstock crack that is visible but was done by a skilled luthier at retrofret guitars in brooklyn.

It sports a bound body, super smooth hidden fret ends, a Toneworks tune-o-matic bridge, and a tusq nut. With its upgraded pickups (DiMarzios according to the previous owner) it sings, loud and clear.
There are no chips but some faint hairline scratches consistent with a gently used guitar can be seen if you look very closely. The frets have been dressed and polished and a new set of D'Addario 10's are on it. It has been kept in a smoke free environment. Hard case included.

2018-02-26 20:10:00,"Kent Americana - Hollow Body - Japan - Vintage - Gold Foil

This is a Kent Americana, made in Japan ca 1964-66 in overall very good shape.  Similar to Guyatone, Teisco, Kingston, Heit, Norma guitars of the era.

Fully hollow offset body with two ""gold foil"" single-coil pickups for that gritty but sweet sound - slightly microphonic.   Perfect for country and Chicago-style blues, older swing styles.  Incredible tone for slide and killer vibe.  

Neck PU impedance = 5.94K.  Bridge PU = 5.91K.  Bridge PU has a replacement coil - everything else is original.

Neck and frets are in excellent shape - truss rod is fully functional.  Action is low and guitar is easy to play.  This is not a ""shredder guitar"" though - it's old and the frets are low by today's standards and response is somewhat uneven over the neck.  Guitar would also benefit from replacing the tuners for better pitch stability.

Finish has some checking, pitting, and scratching, typical for the guitar's age.  There have been some small repairs to the binding as well.  Top displays some slight warpage that does not affect the action or sound.

Does not include case or gig bag.

Price is $430.00.

These are no longer made and are becoming pretty hard to find and very collectible. The Kingsnake is basically the second edition of the Reverend Hellhound.

A vintage celestion speaker (16 ohm) has been installed, which gives the amp a bit more warmth--especially when driven hard. There are two 6L6 power tubes (which were replaced about two years ago and have had very little use since then) and three original 12AX7 preamp tubes which still function well.

There is also a 20W to 60W switching between bigger or smaller rooms, and three different preamp types: US for a Fender Deluxe sound, UK for a vintage ""British"" Marshall-like sound and LoFi for some ""Garage""/Punk vibes. Very nice sounding reverb. 

You can find all the specs and details if you do some research online.

Adding a genuine LESLIE Speaker to your kit has never been easier. The 2101 MkII is highly portable, yet packs all the power of a Vintage Leslie. The Upper Rotor is basically the same as found in our flagship 3300 Leslie, with 150 watts of power feeding a Hi-capacity Driver attached to the traditional, proprietary Leslie Spinning Horn. The Lower Rotor's motion is achieved by our authentic Digital Leslie Engine, and fed through the Stereo 5' Speakers mounted at the front, behind the grill. Enough power for many small to mid-sized gigs, and more than enough when mic'd up through a Sound Reinforcement system. A real Tube Preamp warms up the sound, or may be overdriven to provide the inimitable Leslie Grind. The Three input sources (Traditional 11-pin, New-school 8-pin, or ¼ Guitar cable in) make hookup to any instrument (including Guitars) a snap. A ¼ Footswitch jack means that you'll never have to mess with those old, troublesome floor preamps again. All the performance facets are user-customizable. Combine the 2101 MkII with the Leslie 2121 to achieve the 21 System, a 300 watt Keyboard system.

2018-02-26 18:23:00,"Selling my Lovetone Doppelganger pedal. Lovetone pedals are rare, sought after, and discontinued. 

This is in perfect working condition.
From Lovetone:

The DOPPELGANGERâ„¢ is a mesmerising twin oscillator phaser/vibrato but being in the grand Lovetone tradition it offers a whole range of classic (and non-classic!) uses never previously available in one unit. Its trademark is an unparalleled purity and transparency of tone and harmonic richness making it a real texture machine. The subtle yet ever-changing way the controls interact has a truly mesmerising effect which speaks directly to the sub-conscious mind (as well as the stoned mind!). It covers the whole spectrum from mellow and virtually subliminal, to Hendrix-y, to crunchy and chomping (reminiscent of the ubiquitous 70's phase sound), to swirling rotary-type fx.
On more subtle settings (especially in vibrato mode) it gives movement and life to the sound without discernible processing and because it sounds so natural you can almost forget its there - until you switch it off! In less introvert moments it can warp sounds into multi-dimensional knots or whip up squeals and harmonics into a sci-fi frenzy. It never manages to sound sickly on any setting, and in fact makes an ideal replacement for all the sounds contained in the thesaurus of chorus as it provides plenty of width and attack definition but without the nauseating side effects.

Vibrato mode has a very vibraphone-like modulation and is great for moody jazzers. As well as guitar and bass, the Doppelgangerâ„¢ can of course be used on any instrument and works particularly well when chilling out with classic keyboard sounds!

This guitar is in great shape, it's really a closet classic. Only two tiny tiny marks on the back (tried to show in last two pics) otherwise its in excellent condition.

Extremely well made, easy to play, sounds awesome. Comes with original case

For those not familiar with Collings, definitely do some research. They make fantastic guitars. This guitar is comparable to a Martin 00 12 Fret model.

Has a fresh setup and strings

Collings description:

00 in its original, 12-fret configuration, a guitar shape that was first designed around the time of the Civil War. Its dimensions are similar to a typical classical guitar, with a slotted headstock and small pyramid bridge. The comfortable size and timeless appearance of the Collings 00 is matched by the ease of playing a wide neck and shorter string scale affords. The tone is typically balanced and precise, and we've seen it adopted for a wide range of playing styles from simple vocal accompaniment to ragtime solos. When you want the durability of a modern guitar but one that appears rooted in an earlier, simpler time, the 00 is a versatile choice.

2018-02-26 15:57:00,"This is Review of Delta 1010
In Use

What have I run on my Delta? Logic Audio windows 4.7, 4.8.1, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 (and hundreds of versions in between that I can't talk about). I have a highly automated system with Logic Control that puts LOTS of demands on the audio interface. I use Kontakt, FM7, EXS, Battery, Pro 52, Es1, Es2, EVP88, B4, and more. I use logic Compressor on nearly every audio track; I use Waves TrueVerbs in every song along with at leas 1 instance of the Wave's Ultra maximizer and often the C4 Multiband compressor. These are not ""lite"" plugins. I also use the Delta 1010 with Sonar, Cubase SX, Acid 4, Sound Forge 6, Reason and Vegas Video 3. And more.



The thing about the Delta 1010 is that I don't think about limits when I am in the creation stages of the song. I just use what I want to use. Near the end of the song I may have 16-20 softsynth/sampler instances, 20 midi tracks, plugins on everything including mastering plugins on the master outs. 4-8 software busses, eq's used lavishly and automation running not only on audio tracks, but on effects sends and returns and softsynth parameters. Then I might get an overload, a click or a pop. But this is at a point where they *should* occur, with the CPU maxed to it's last gasp. This is all on a 1.4 ghz Athlon, certainly nothing special by today's hardware standards. For me the Delta 1010 simply works. The constant troubleshooting that got in the way of making music no longer happens, and that makes me one happy tweakhead. :)

Cool Features I like



As a samplist, the delta 1010 is a great choice as it works at any sample rate, including the odd rates like 36khz, 29 khz and 39.11 khz or whatever. You can take it up to 24bit 96khz if you want.

The outputs can take balanced or unbalanced cables, impedance can be set to -10 or +4 depending on your mixer. Running +4 balanced allows you to interface with professional mixing boards with minimal noise.



You get 8 analog ins and 8 analog outs, stereo s/pdif in and out, so that 10 in and 10 out al together (hence the name is ""1010"") and all the ins and outs can be used simultaneously. This allows enormous flexibility. Go mixerless if you want and connect synths and preamps directly to the 1010. Or connect to a large 8 bus board. Or configure it so out 1-2 is the master out and use the other 6 outs as busses to hardware signal processors.

The Delta 1010 has a midi port which is reliable and can be used for heavy synth work.

What I don't like about the Delta 1010



The switches on the back that switch from -10 to +4 can be noisy when you press them. Perhaps too much dust has gotten into them in my studio, but they sound like a dusty pan pot when switched. Fortunately, these are just set and forget switches. You only press them when reconfiguring your rig.



The documentation in the manual is only fair. They could have been more specific about IRQs, disabling ACPI in windows, and about troubleshooting.



The bundled Logic Delta used to work only on Windows 98se, but now works on all Windows platforms.   This is a severely stripped down version of Logic. You should not get a Delta 1010 because ""it includes Logic"". It's just a teaser to get your feet wet. If you want to run Logic, get Logic Gold or Platinum 5.

As you see, the negative issues are minor.

What does the Delta 1010 lack that other interfaces have?



The Delta 1010 does not have mic preamps. You cannot plug a mic, or a guitar, or a turntable directly to it without a preamp. You can connect any line level source, from professional processors to consumer hi fi equipment.

Two Channels, 60 watts. 

Channel 1: offers a range of Fender styles, from chiming clean to sizzling, saturated 'tweed' tone. The Punch control sets the amount of midrange break-up and overdrive, and a Bite button tightens the low end and adds brightness. 

Channel 2, has amp sounds ranging from crunchy Marshall, to gnarly Vox AC30, to slamming Mesa Rectifier styles. A Weep button increases the amount of even harmonics and thickens the sound. Its powerful and sophisticated midrange control, appropriately named Growl, can produce brutal 'scooped' tones without any loss of girth or volume.

Now widely regarded as the industry standard in guitar pedal compression, the Mini Ego Compressor brings another level of control to what is expected and needed by today's guitar players, in a mini format.

What does a compressor do? A compressor adds an element of control to your playing level -- it will bring the quieter parts up and the louder parts down. While an ordinary compressor pedal can give you an element of control, a great compressor will give you the ""feel"" that other average compressors lack. If you've played a great tube amp when it's being pushed hard, you'll know what a great natural compressor feels like.

Based on the incredible success of the original Ego but featuring switches for tone (dark and bright) and attack (slow and fast) you can tweak your tone to a standard of a pedal twice its size. By keeping the clean blend of the original, your original signal to be blended in so you can get all the benefits of a great compressor (picking up the notes that aren't as strong and increasing sustain) but you have the option to remove the squash at the front by bringing the bypassed signal in. With this control, you can have full country squash or open studio level parallel compression. Basically, the Mini Ego gives you complete control of every aspect of your compression.

So, with a comprehensive array of controls and a core tone that is pure, you won't find a compressor that works perfectly as an ""always on"" or as ""an effect"" that is more highly regarded than the Mini Ego from Wampler Pedals.

It's 4lbs , so you can carry it all over town on the subway, and it's LOUD.

8ohms 300watts
16ohms 150watts

I've never used it at 4ohms, but at 16ohms it's loud, at 8ohms it's blisterering. But the cool thing is it holds its tone at pretty much any volume. Because of the tube preamp it cleans up with the guitars volume knob and has a low gain input as well to use as a pedal platform.

Because of the two JJ 12ax7s in the preamp, it takes OD pedals just like the original.

Has an FX loop with a loop level knob for balancing it with whatever you run in it.

2018-02-26 13:24:00,"Limited Edition run of Korina bodied telecaster by the G&L custom shop. 
This was the guitar that went out for reviews, so its older than the date says on the stamp and most likely the first guitar. You can recognize the dark streak on the upper part of the guitar. and it does NOT have a quarter sawn maple neck like the other models do. 
It comes with the case candy and paperwork. 
Perfect condition, plays and sounds amazing. It is beautifully light and well balanced. 

One of the pickups had been replaced at some point, but with the correct type  (Seymour Duncan JB in the bridge and SD59 in the neck) without a cover. To match, they took the cover off the remaining original pickup and that cover is in the case. The coil tap has also been switched so it only affects the neck pickup. 
That knob is cracked.  
so, same pickup configuration as stock, one is original. 
let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!

This is the review for this exact guitar.  from guitar player, all reviews regarding this model were THIS actual guitar. 
The ASAT Deluxe II starts with identical specs as the Classic Bluesboy, but swaps out the Tele-style single-coil and plate bridge for a humbucker and a TonePros Tune-o-matic. Those might seem like minor changes, but I found the tonal effect of the bridge and stoptail was dramatic, giving this ASAT a unique sound and feel even before plugging it in. Compared to the Classic Bluesboy, the acoustic tone of the Deluxe II was louder and punchier, with a fuller midrange. And the string tension felt immediately different, propelling notes forward with a solid ""thunk."" That's not to say the Deluxe's bridge is necessarily better--some might miss the more scooped midrange and delicate airy twang of the classic Tele-style plate bridge. But if you've always wished for more oomph from a bolt-on neck guitar, without giving up the stringy quality of the 25w"" scale, you should check out this ASAT.

The neck pickup is a Duncan '59, which brings more snarl and tighter lows than the similar Seth Lover 'bucker in the Bluesboy. But make no mistake: the Deluxe II is predominately vintage-flavored, delivering a softer, clearer, and more open neck tone than the comparably crisp, midrange-heavy Dragon II-equipped PRS Custom I referenced. The Deluxe II's Duncan JB bridge pickup further pumps up the volume and growl, but I found it a particularly good match for the milder neck tone--I enjoyed flicking between all three pickup settings without ever feeling the need to tweak an amp or step on a pedal. And a push/pull tone pot taps the coils of both pickups, yielding single-coil flavors that are somewhat blander than, say, the bridge pickup of the Classic Bluesboy, but still entirely useable.

The Deluxe II--like all the Korina Collection ASATs--features a quartersawn hard-rock maple neck. But as an aside, I had the opportunity to compare a prototype Deluxe II with a flatsawn neck, which I found a hair more compressed and sparkling, the quartersawing contributing punch and slightly more stability during pedal-steel-type bends. I'd be happy with either, and it's a testament to G&L's consistency that this difference was audible at all.

Chances are that if you're looking at this, you already know what it is. If you don't, this is a very lightweight, portable, plug in OR battery powered PA system from Roland. And as you can see from the pictures, it's in GREAT condition! Other than some scratches on the bottom and front, you'd never know it wasn't new. And at $100 off, it's a hell of a deal!

Here are some specs from Roland...

""""""""""The CUBE Street EX gives you everything you need to get a great sound out of your electric guitar, acoustic-electric, or vocal microphone. A handy built-in tuner helps you sound your best, and COSM amp and instrument modeling gives you solid tones for any style of music. You can fine-tune your sound with a 3-band EQ and reverb on each channel. And with the stereo link outputs, you can connect a second CUBE Street EX for even more sound coverage.

Roland CUBE amps are famous for performance that exceeds their physical size, and the CUBE Street EX is no exception. With two 8"" speakers for powerful lows and rich mids, plus two 2"" speakers for crystal-clear highs, this amp sounds incredible. It's capable of high-volume output that defies its physical dimensions, which is why it's just as suitable as a PA as it is a guitar or vocal amplifier. Best of all, it can run for up to 20 hours on just eight AA alkaline batteries.

Roland's innovative i-CUBE LINK interface gives you easy, quick connectivity with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. You get two-way communication with your iOS devices, so you can jam with music tracks and send studio-grade guitar tones directly to your favorite recording apps. The i-CUBE LINK jack may also be used as a regular stereo input, letting you plug in virtually any music player or audio device and play it through your CUBE Street EX. The companion CUBE JAM app (available free from the App Store) turns your iOS device into a versatile jamming, recording, and learning station.
Roland CUBE Street EX Combo Amp/Portable PA Features:

    50-watt portable PA speaker with 2 x 8"" LF drivers and 2 x 2"" HF drivers
    Perfect for amplifying electric guitars, acoustic-electric guitars, vocals, keyboards, and drum machines
    2 mic/instrument inputs plus stereo line inputs give you diverse connectivity options
    Built-in tuner and COSM amplifier modeling
    Reverb and 3-band EQ on each channel
    Connect your tablet or smartphone via i-CUBE LINK

though these are actually more popular since the Beatles and the rolling stones played them:)
also has been reissued for quiet sometimes now.. This is NOT a reissue, this is the real deal made in 60's by Gibson ""epiphone"" USA.

really classic tone on this, and an amazing playability and comfort on the neck, not too thick or thin, just right.
the P90's are just killer on this!

a couple of things have been changed that are actually an upgrade
1. it was re-fretted, job was immaculate, really smooth, no buzz, very comfortable action. 
2. tuners replaced for same identical tuners but these are made by grovers.

only thing that's bringing the price down (these are 4k-6k) is
previous owner has modify the pickup cavity to fit humbuckers, which is kind of not that bad if you ever want to try this with humbuckers you ready to go, you shouldn't tho, because these p90's are just amazing!
the modification is actually very minor and only done on one side of each pickup about a quarter of an inch.
NO BREAKS OR REPAIRS guitar is solid and in great condition!

anyway this is a steal of a price for one of those!

2018-02-26 10:34:00,"This gorgeous 24K gold capo with a Crimson Paua inlay is less than a year old and has never been used.  It comes with one set of Teflon fretpads and two sets of Rubber fretpads (XL and Standard sizes).

The Thalia Capo's unique, patented design means that you can squeeze the capo with your fretting hand in its natural position on the neck. Thalia has also gone to great lengths to design a capo that will not take your guitar out of tune: this is done by offering interchangeable fretpads so that you can match the fretboard radius of your instrument. 

The capo comes with two microfiber cleaning/gig pouches along with one Standard Tension & two High/XL Tension (Rubber Fretpad Tuning kits).  Each kit  includes several different fretpads designed to fit a range of instruments with the following radii: 0"" for Classical, 7.25"". 9.5"", 10"", 12"", 15"" & 16"".  The High/XL Tension Fretpads are 2mm taller than the standard tension fretpads, and are used with 12-string guitars, Ukuleles, Banjos and certain guitars with low profile necks.

2018-02-26 10:32:00,"Selling two Electro Voice RE 320 dynamic mics. Excellent condition, barely used! I'm a radio journalist, interested in field recording, and had no idea what I was doing when I was buying my first gear -- these are fantastic mics but just not designed for field work. 

The RE320 is a mic mainly designed for recording music. It is ideal for vocals, horns, guitar amp, bass amp and drums. The two-position ""Dual Personality"" frequency response switch offers flat response or a specifically tailored kick drum EQ. The drum EQ gives you that sought after punch sound. An integrated humbucking coil keeps hum and buzz to a minimum compared to other mics. Make sure you check out the durable and great sounding Electro Voice RE320 Dynamic Mic.

Let me know if you have any questions!

2018-02-26 10:30:00,"Up for sale is a Satin White Gibson Les Paul Junior. These are no longer made and pretty hard to find these days, especially in this white color. In fact, non custom shop juniors are pretty rare altogether currently. This guitar is in excellent shape (please see below for satin finish info), and is all original.

The satin finish is very thin, and ""ages"" quite quickly as a result, thus the guitar does have some wear in the finish, as well as some buckle rash and minor bumps, etc here and there that come with normal playing. I have tried my best to show all of these in the pictures, but please feel free to request more pictures or info.

Comes with a Roadrunner gigbag.


Please feel free to message with any questions.

The label says: The Pfretzschner made in Germany exclusively for Wm. Lewis and Son, Chicago, Illinois, probably made in the 1950s.

It has a Fishman BP00 pickup on the bridge. It has a repair on the side. There is chipping on the edge of the lower back. Relic finish. Sounds incredible as an acoustic or plugged in to an amp. No case.

I'm a guitar player and would trade for an Esquire or Telecaster Guitar.

I has a Fender Mexican body, Warmoth neck, they have changed their options since I had this guitar built but it is closest to the SRV type neck, thick and chunky. It has vintage style fender tuners. The pickups are Lindy Fralin Blues Specials with a baseplate on the bridge pickup. Upgraded pots. Rosewood neck. The body does have some chips in in the finish, they are all cosmetic and don't effect playability or functionality. 

I am selling it because I no longer use it. Unfortunately I don't have a case for it. It currently resides in a double case that can't part with.

2018-02-26 02:14:00,"Original Vintage 1979 Rickenbacker 4001 Bass Guitar in Burgundyglo Red. 
Made in the USA
Includes the Original Hard Shell Case.

Bass is in very nice shape for it's age. A few bumps here and there but overall lovely condition.
Rosewood Fingerboard is great. Dual Truss Rods work with no issue.

The serial plate clearly shows it's from January 1979, indicated by the letters ""SA""
Just hard to read two of the four digit numbers below, which indicate the number it which it came off the assembly line that month in 1979. There was an incident years ago which involved melted plastic on the jack plate, which is why it's hard to make out two digits of the number.

The original bridge was replaced with a Leo Quan BadAss II Bridge. I will include an Original Authentic Rickenbacker Bridge if you'd like to put it on.

The case is missing the handle but I've purchased a replacement to install. I will include it and you can install it if you like. Otherwise the case works great. Latches lock down and hinges are tight. It shows some outer wear but that's normal for a 39 year old case.

2018-02-26 01:41:00,"Zoom MS-100bt Multi-Fx pedal (Blue) - great condition - $120 ($190 new)

This guitar pedal rips, flat out. It has crystal clear sound through 100 pre-loaded guitar effects such as an excellent tremolo, phaser, Chorus, distortions, wah's, and much much more. I wouldn't have initially thought this pedal would be as handy and good as it is, but it has served me well every time I plugged it in. Need to pay the bills so I need to find a good home for it. Below are technical details, but I can say that it sounds great, is versatile, and is in perfect working condition. 

* Bluetooth compatible with iOS 4; 3 or later devices, Browse, sample, purchase and download effects via Bluetooth, StompShare iOS app available for free download via the App Store
* Easy-to-use interface includes LCD, footswitch, and analog-style cursor keys/parameter knobs, Integrated auto-chromatic tuner, Tap tempo function
* 100 preloaded effects types (92 stomp box effects, 8 amp models), can be used in any combination, Use up to six effects simultaneously
* 30 preset patches ready for immediate use, Create and store up to 50 original patches
* Two 1/4""input jacks, two 1/4""output jacks, AC (adapter sold separately) and battery powered, Up to seven hours of operation using two AA batteries (included)


Imagine a powerful, easy-to-use guitar stompbox loaded with 100 of the world's most popular effects and amp models. Then imagine being able to instantly download even more effects and models directly from your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. That's the Zoom MS-100BT: The world's first multi-effects pedal to incorporate Bluetooth® technology. In conjunction with Zoom's free StompShare app (available for download in the Apple App Store), you can try, buy and download new effects any time you need them--in the middle of a session, before your next gig, or just for practice. With the MS-100BT, the perfect guitar sound is always just a swipe away. 

Single Stompbox Design
With a heavy duty, die-cast body, the MS-100BT has the classic look of a single analog stompbox. It features a large LCD and analog-style cursor keys/parameter knobs that together form an easy-to-use graphical interface. This intuitive design makes creating, saving and rearranging the effect chain a breeze and provides easy navigation in live and studio settings.
Amp Simulation
A highly refined sigmoid curve clipper re-creates the smooth clipping of a tube amp's waveform. This allows the MS-100BT to simulate amplifier sounds, including clean, crunch and full-gain drive tones that are authentic to the original models while maintaining the nuances of picking and strumming techniques.
Model Your Sound
The MS-100BT's eight super-real amp models range from vintage gear to the latest trends in amp technology, each with its own distinct cabinet modeling that can be used to alter its tone characteristics. In addition, you can pair any of the available amp models with any of the available cabinet models and let you're creativity run wild. Power a VX JMI 2x12 cabinet with a Delux-R amp, or combine the MS 1859 amp and the DZ Drive 4x12 cabinet. It's up to you! The MS-100BT also provides you with the versatility to match the output of a given amp/cabinet model to whatever you're playing through (Line, Combo Front, Stack Front, Combo Power Amp, Stock Power Amp).
The Most Realistic Sounds to Date
The all-new ZFX-IV DSP effects processor boasts amazing power and clarity, upgrading everything from sound to functionality over previous ZFX versions. By using 32-bit floating-point processing, the MS-100BT can produce sounds that are more realistic than ever before.
All the Classic Stomps in One
The MS-100BT offers 92 diverse types of effects, including some of the world's most popular stompbox guitar pedals and rack-mounted processors. The pedal's wide range of effects includes distortion, compression, modulation, delay and reverb.
Up to Six Simultaneous Effects
With the MS-100BT, you can use up to six stompbox and amp effects simultaneously and arrange them in any order you like. This allows you the freedom to build complex tones, as well as the ability to bring individual elements in and out of the effects chain as you like.
Presets Right Out of the Box
Right out-of-the-box, the MS-100BT allows you to create and store up to 50 of your original patches. To get you started, 30 of these patches are preprogrammed and form a versatile collection of guitar sounds that include some of the world's greatest stompbox and amp effects.
Stereo In and Out
The MS-100BT features two 1/4-inch inputs that let you to use the pedal with not only guitars, but stereo instruments such as synthesizers and samplers, as well as other effects and processors that have stereo outputs. The pedal's two 1/4-inch outputs allow you to maximize the characteristics of the pedal's stereo effects and record them using line level connections.
Output Modes for Stage and Studio
The MS-100BT's amp modeling function offers different output modes for optimizing the pedal's effects based on how you connect it to your rig. In addition to having modes for the front inputs of combo and stack amps, the MS-100BT can be used as a preamp when connected to a power amp input. You can also achieve realistic amp sounds optimal for recording by selecting the direct mode for line connections.
Pick Your Patch Order
With the MS-100BT, you can program which patches are recalled and the order in which they appear. For example, you could select three patches--(A) CLEAN TONE, (B) HEAVY RIFF and (C) LEAD SOLO--and program the MS-100BT to cycle through only those three tones each time you press the footswitch.
Smaller Boards, Bigger Tones
Perfect for use in combination with traditional stompboxes, the MS-100BT can be added to your pedalboard to decrease the size and complexity of your setup, while expanding your system's effects and modeling capabilities.
Precise Tuning
The pedal's highly accurate auto-chromatic tuner offers smooth, real-time response, which makes turning your guitar effortless. When you're in the middle of a performance or practicing alone, simply hold down the pedal's footswitch to start getting your strings back in tune. In addition, the MS-100BT's LCD makes the tuner easy to see on a dark stage. You can also tune silently in the tuner's MUTE mode or with all effects bypassed in its BYPASS mode.
Power Proof
Providing versatile power options, the MS-100BT operates via AC adapter (sold separately), as well as battery power. Two standard AA batteries (included) provide up to seven hours of continuous mono input use and up to five hours of continuous operation when using the stereo inputs.

This guitar rips, flat out. It has crystal clear sound through the ASAT bridge pickup and P-90 in the neck. It's smooth, superbly responsive to pedals and overdrive, and stays in tune perfectly. JUST had it set up again by a local guru in the East Village. I have to get this to a new home due to money needs (the taxman cometh). If you know about these guitars, you know what a deal this is. I haven't seen one on Reverb for less than $1300.

The P-90 pickup was originally developed by Gibson around 1946, and was a mainstay in their hollow body jazz line for years. It was the also original pickup used in the the first Les Paul guitars in the early 50's. Using a fairy shallow, wide bobbin and a bar magnet underneath, the P-90 develops a thicker tone than a traditional Fender single coil, with more midrange. A good P-90 is a must for any serious player, but they've gotten a bad rap from builders winding them too hot, resulting in a dull one-dimensional tone.
G&L's P-90 is wound to around 6K ohms, which is on the low side for a P-90. The result is one of the cleanest, clearest P-90's that we've experienced and it's a dynamite neck pickup. It has some of the characteristics of a good Tele® pickup but much better clarity, note separation and percussive bass response.  As more gain is applied, the pickup takes on a creamy voice that sings nicely, without the midrange getting too clogged up and stuffy as sometimes happens with an over-wound P-90. There is still a good amount of note definition, and again it's less mushy than a traditional ALNICO pickup, but leaner than the ASAT MFD. How does it sound compared to the Seymour Duncan Seth Lover used in the standard Bluesboy? Leaner, cleaner, with more high end extension and a tighter low end. For jazz or really fat blues crunch the Seth Lover is likely the best choice, but the P-90 stylistically is a closer cousin to the bridge pickup.
The ASAT Classic bridge pickup is well known for it's strong output, excellent clarity, and ability to both twang and rock. The low notes have a great chewy, bouncy twang that is perfect for country picking, and through our Fender Bassman there's plenty of detail, depth and complex high end. However the ASAT's beefy output also makes it a great lead pickup, and with overdrive it will shower you with overtones, harmonics, and much better dimensionality than most bridge humbuckers. It does not have quite the midrange heft that a P-90 bridge pickup would have, but it can absorb mountains of gain without the sound become smeared or flabby.
Tonally, these pickups work nicely together, and are closely matched in output. Both pickups combined produce a nice sparkly rhythm tone with lots of chime and detail. The bass is very clean with a nice springy vibe, and it's a great setting for county picking, or when you feel like knocking out a little  George Harrison or Chet Atkins.
The G&L Detroit Muscle is a great reason to take a plunge and play something different. The Marina blue finish is super-attractive, the look of the P-90/ASAT bridge looks kind of hot-rodded itself, and if you don't think you like P-90 pickups, it may be because you have not played a good one. G&L has made a really good P-90, and in the process opened up a new range of options for players willing to think out of the box and forge their own style.

If you're looking at this, chances are you're already familiar with the impeccable reputation that Suhr have built for themselves over the years. Known for their high-end boutique hot-rodded guitars, the craftsmanship and playability of these guitars is unparalleled. 

The pau ferro neck feels incredibly comfortable under your fretting hand. The feeling of the bare wood is hard to describe but instantly feels right at home. Saying that it ""feels like a million bucks"" is underselling it, in all honesty. Along with being super comfortable and feeling silky smooth, the pau ferro neck/fretboard combination provides a warm tone that is brighter than traditional rosewood, though still has some of that mid-range that you can quickly lose with a maple neck and maple fretboard combination. The addition of the wooden knob covers and wooden pickguard really help match the aesthetics of this guitar with the killer playability and sounds that it produces.

The HSS Suhr pickup configuration let's you split the bridge humbucker for some more vintage-based tones, or use the humbucker in its full capacity for a rich and thick bridge tone. Access to every fret on the neck is very easy, so you can shred away all night long without any hand fatigue, whether you're playing chords or ripping creamy lead lines.

HISTORY
Originally purchased new from Sweetwater Sound in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where I was informed that Dave Mustaine (of Megadeth fame) had personally tried it out and ""hated it."" I said, ""Perfect. I'll take it."" Years later I refinished it by hand. All of the ""faded cherry"" was sanded away and refinished with a natural mahogany stain. All imperfections were eliminated to restore it to ""like new"" condition. The pick guard and truss rod cover have been veneered with a very thin layer of water buffalo hide. The pickup cavities have been lined with copper tape for extra EMF shielding. The neck is dead straight. The action is  great. If you're looking for one-of-a-kind, look no further. There isn't a sexier, more natural vibe V out there.

Fernandes '57 Style Stratocaster with New Old Stock Fernandes neck with rosewood fingerboard (nice figuring on the rosewood, too). Very much of a ""sleeper"" guitar. Lots of famous people have used Fernandes over the years and for good reason.

Looks like the New Old Stock replacement neck is exactly the same dimensions as the maple neck (neck heel length/width/depth, number of frets, etc. etc.) that's on the guitar now, so if you ever want to switch necks, should be a breeze.

Comes with whammy bar and gig bag. Great sounding and playing guitar with a fast neck. Only what's shown in the photos is included.

A Killer Synth and Much More!
How would you like a killer live-performance synth that can perform double duty as a serious 8-track recorder? With Roland's JUNO-Gi, that's exactly what you get. Roland loaded the JUNO-Gi up over 1,300 sounds and the same sound-shaping powers you've come to expect from the JUNO series. But here's a new twist: the JUNO-Gi is endowed with a full-functioning 8-track recorder. USB connectivity lets you turn the JUNO-Gi into a complete interface solution when paired with your favorite DAW software.

When it comes to a synth, the number and type of sounds available is a top concern. Roland packed the JUNO-Gi with over 1,300 sounds covering a huge array of instruments and styles. And if you're a gigging musician, you'll dig the Live Sets. Layer up to four sounds by stacking or splitting tones and save them together as a Live Set. Plus, a Special Live Set section dives in deep to take full advantage of the JUNO-Gi sound engine, giving you the most advanced synth sounds possible!

But of course, a gigging keyboard is only worth its salt if it's easy to move. Not only is the JUNO-Gi a snap to schlep from gig to gig (it's very lightweight), but you can run it on batteries too! Imagine how easy it would be to take your battery-powered JUNO-Gi synth and a battery-powered BA-330 keyboard amp to the gig. And you could play just about anywhere. Throw out a tip jar and rock on the corner! Be ready in an instant for an impromptu coffee house gig. The world will be your oyster!

As if this wasn't enough reason to click ""Add to Cart,"" the JUNO-Gi is also a full-functioning 8-track digital record (2-track simultaneous recording, 8-track playback). You've got guitar/mic/line inputs so you can record nearly anything, and a 32GB SDHC card (not included) can hold up to 192 hours of recording (that's a lot!). Of course, you've got full import/export support for transferring files to and from a computer and the same effects built into BOSS's GT series are onboard to handle spicing up your tracks.

When you combine the JUNO-Gi with the bundled Cakewalk Sonar LE 8.5 software, you have a complete digital audio workstation package for your PC. In addition, the MIDI Controller Mode lets you operate the JUNO-Gi as a MIDI master keyboard for controlling your DAW or external MIDI devices. The JUNO-Gi is a powerhouse of a synth, with everything else just being icing on the cake.

This works 100% perfectly but there are two cosmetic flaws that I want to point out. There are close up photos of each to show the flaws. The front left corner of the recorder is cracked. Also, on input A, the cover fell off. Again, these don't impact the functionality of the recorder, but needed to be pointed out.

For sale is an electro harmonix big box deluxe electric mistress.  It is in full working order. This is not the 70s version.  It's either from the 90s or the early 00s.  This is a thick, lush flanger, that nails the 'Message in a Bottle' tone, as well as J Mascis's flanger sounds.  The matrix option cuts off the LFO, so it doesn't swoop, and stays in one position.  This is great for getting metallic sounding tones, or that guitar sound in the beginning of Led Zeppelin's 'Houses of the Holy'.

2018-02-25 18:11:00,"1972 Ibanez Telecaster Bass Guitar Fender Copy Made in Japan at the Fujigen Gakki manufacturing Plant.
Ivory White with Maple Fingerboard.

RARE. These were direct copies of the Fenders, down to the mid-body pickup design and the color.
The tele versions are particularly hard to find these days as they were not as common as the Jazz and Precision copies made during these years. This one is in overall very good condition.

CONDITION: 
Overall, very nice condition for it's age. Does have obvious age wear though. The Ivory color on the body has darkened a bit over time. The front and back of the bass have light wear and scratches, (the flash from the digital camera sometimes brings out marks that are not visible to the naked eye), and the front and back also have some long finish cracks/checking running lengthwise as seen in the photos. The neck is a nice, straight, slender C shape that is comfortable to play, and the frets have very little wear and lots of life left in them. Truss rod turns with no issues. The tuners work well and hold tune. 

The case is a recent Zenison hard shell case that the bass fits in well.
I've described the guitar and it's condition accurately and the photos pretty much tell the story. It plays like a dream.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

$500 cash. No lowball offers please and you MUST provide your email address and phone number. I won't reply unless you do. I need to know I'm responding to a real person.

This publication is only in Seattle, you cant find this magazine anywhere else. I live in Kent WA. Its dated May 24th 2017

His Band Started It All
Soundgarden formed in 1984, well before the city's golden age of rock began, and before most other notable guitar-heavy acts were playing, with the noted exception of Green River (which would split into Mudhoney and two-fifths of Pearl Jam).

 In the band's infancy, Cornell sang from behind the drum kit, flanked by bassist Hiro Yamamato and guitarist Kim Thayil. A year later, the vocalist deferred percussion duties, and the move changed the dynamic--and the trajectory--of the band. Ironically, Cornell decided to focus on vocals after watching Matt Cameron

 drum for the band Feedback. As he recalled thinking in Mark Yarm's book Everybody Loves Our Town, ""Oh, that's what a good drummer is supposed to play like. Maybe my talent lies elsewhere."" His epiphany opened the door for Cameron to join the band in 1986--and proved to be quite an understatement.

Looking for a band/drummer (or both) to fill the second sublet spot in my studio on a monthly rent basis for $215/month. I've had the 170 sqft space for 7 years now and it's great: soundproof, air conditioning, utilities included. Open 24/hrs, 7 days a week, free parking in building, close to 7 train, very secure. Elevator and dollies for gear. I use it primarily for practicing and occasionally rehearsing in the evenings, my other sublettor uses it primarily for practicing drums.

YOUR HOURS:

26 hours a week guaranteed (mostly daytime, with some evenings and weekend time as well). Extra time (i.e. early and late) open for booking between the three of us as needed via internet calendar. To spare you the math, it works out to about $1.90 an hour.

THE GEAR:

I have a set of Gretsch USA Custom drums you're welcome to use, plus a bass amp, multiple guitar amps, and a PA with a 16-channel mixer. My other sublettor also has a set of Gretsch USA Custom drums in case you want to go two kits. I would prefer you don't bring in too much additional gear since space may get too tight, but we can negotiate if that's important to you.

YOU: 

Reliable, timely, professional, and good at communication. You don't have to be a pro but I assume you will be considering a hobbyist probably doesn't need 26 hours a week--although if you're a hobbyist, that's great too. Just make sure you're the kind of person two professional musicians want to share all their gear with!

2018-02-25 12:56:00,"Hey Craigslist, 

I have a few item to sell, please read the below descriptions.

Please note all items are for local, in person, cash only exchanges. Please provide a phone number for a response, if the post is still up the items are still available.

I can meet in Brooklyn 11216 or Manhattan 10010. 

1) Yamaha CS 15 analog mono synthesizer with Kenton Pro Solo MK11 midi/cv setup $780 -----
 I'm only selling the CS as a package with the Kenton

----The CS-15 is a wonderful and hard to find with a great tone and versatility unlike others. Excellent physical and working condition. Look this one up it has a bunch of features over other ""similar"" models.  Audio in with control, two ADSRs, independent LP, BP and HP filter switches for both oscillators independent glide for both voices and each oscillator can be controlled independently via separate CV inputs so you can send it two separate sequences or separate the oscillators tot play two different notes at once, the control is like having two note polyphony or two synths in one. The CS-15 also has CV and trigger outs to control other gear. All the waves sound strong but I have to say the triangle wave especially is one of the best I've ever heard, and mixed with the bandpass filter you can get those very vocal / vowel sounding patches. The bass is definitely strong and the leads can get to that very smooth and bubbly place which is a signature of the CS series. The PW and PMW is also very noteworthy with separate knobs for both sections. There is LFO control on the VCO, VCF and VCA.  I actually hate to see this one go especially since they are hard to come by if I happen to change my mind...


2) Korg Poly 800 analog synth with Moog slayer modification $500

The Poly 800 is in excellent physical and working condition and comes with two* sets of presents, you get the factory patches and another great set from an old school synth website I can't remember. There are Modifications for filter, resonance, audio input and FM mod, this takes an already good synth to great levels. The main switch controls modulation to DCO1 & 2, noise or audio input 1 or 2. Filter mods for hands on control of Cutoff, RES and FM* with an additional switch for the filter slope between 12 or 24. Independent knobs for level control of audio Inputs 1 and 2. The onboard step sequencer is a great plus and everyone loves the 800's modulation joystick which can combine a mixture of VCF DCO and pitch modulation. This synth has a distinct character and really can make many unique sounds.


3) Vintage Panasonic RX - 5080 Boom Box ($140) Ghetto Blaster with Mic and RCA input and output for computer of phone. 

This one is a beach day classic or great around the apartment.  The connections on the back make it easy to hook up a computer or iPod/iphone, I can include the cord to do so. This is a perfect alternative to bluetooth speakers and looks a lot better in my opinion. The box is in great physical condition, tone knob for nice bass/treb control. This can definitely get LOUD if you want it to. Runs on simple AC adapter cord (included) or D batteries, portable! This unit also has an ambient setting. Its a pretty random feature but it does give a cool effect. The tape player has been unreliable, it will play but often eats tapes, so I usually don't use it. The radio (FM/AM) receiver works but the antenna has been broken (this is an easy fix and can be replaced with any secondhand piece)


4) DOD R - 845 spring reverb ($180) In great condition all around. Sounds great on acoustic and electronic instruments, and has 4 band EQ.

5) Electro Harmonix Knock Out Attack Equalizer (25) Good working condition

6) Modified Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive pedal ($80) This pedal has 4 switches that create a variety of effects. I am not a guitar player, but it has worked well with analog synthesizers and drum machines. 


7) Heavy Duty Road case - Modular Case Project $50

18.5x14"" Bottom 6"" deep Top 3""deep

This is a reinforced card case that originally was for transportation of a 8 thousand dollar Phase One Digital Camera Back. I was going to possibly use this as a case for a modular set up but have since abandoned the project. The case has key / lock access with three spare key, metal clips for straps on both sides, ruler feet on the bottom side and carrying handle.

2018-02-25 12:41:00,"Rare Klemt Echolette S40 SHOWSTAR in amazing condition.
This guitar amp was made in West Germany in the 60s. As used by the Beatles when they were in Hamburg.

The Showstar is a 2x el34 based amp, basically a Marshall jtm45. -with the tremolo circuit-- The tone is impossibly deep and rich, with huge, HUGE, vintage, beefy iron vibe. I really can't over-stress how great the tone is. 

The heart and soul is of course, that amazing, gritty, distorted tone as you begin to heat things up. You simply MUST(!) jumper the inputs! Things start to get really interesting at about 1/2 volume and keep getting better the more you turn it up, until you are in full-on, unsurpassed, pure, real golden era, mind-destroying, cascading distortion. I ADORE the ""sag"" and compression you get out of this old girl when things start to get toasty. Glorious. This amp has phenomenal, tight break-up and creamy, squishy, gritty overdrive. It is a real wall-of-sound smear of stunning German tube tone. The trem is very nice and mellow. A lot like the marshall sound, less so the fender. The ORIGINAL! ....... heaven!

Shipping will be calculated more precisely depending on your location.

2018-02-25 10:50:00,"Hi,

I am selling my digital piano for space and a possible move. It is a beautiful instrument with many features, as well as a stunning furniture item. 

I learned to play on this instrument and eventually became a Piano teacher myself (at Frank and Camille's piano shop in NYC), the instrument has a solid weighted action which helped improve my finger dexterity and made it easy to do fast scales and arpeggios. European Pianos such as Hamburg Steinway, Bosendorfer and Schimmel have similar key weight. The LCD shows the keys you play as notes on a staff both bass and treble clef, this helps ALOT in learning to ready sheet music as you can reference a key to what is written on the sheet instantly. 

It has a wide array of voices from Piano, Guitar, Brass, Strings, Voice and Drums. You can do split voice,change tuning, and transposing. You can also play any voice with an auto-accompaniment which provides bass, drums, and pad backing for your playing, it changes as you change chords to match the harmony. 

It has a large sound with 60W 4 speaker system (2 subs and 2 regular) , full responsive MIDI in/out (ive hooked it up to many DAWs and VSTi and it works flawlessly. It also has dual headphone and audio out. 

The outside cabinet is beautiful, it is a wood grain mahogany with a polished finish, always cleaned and no major scratches or chips. The pedals still have their covers. It is compact and has a small footprint, perfect for homes and apartments. 

If you would like to come see it feel free to call me at  show contact info
 , im near the A and J lines 111st Station. Id be happy to demo this unit for you. 

i also have the manual for the piano as well as bench and polish which is included

Thanks

2018-02-25 10:48:00,"This guitar has been well cared for. Stored in the case, which is in great condition.  There are a couple of places where the color is worn away -- in just the right spots -- but not the finish. There is one place where the finish is chipped. I think all of the marks and the chip are in the photos.  I recently replaced the nut. Aside from that, my understanding is that everything is original. I have not replaced anything else since I purchased the guitar.  The ""inspected by"" tag is still in the case. The case has no tears or stains inside. There are a couple of nicks to the vinyl finish on the outside of the case, but no chips in the wood. This is a great guitar.

This Alvarez guitar with a hand-selected solid cedar top, rosewood back and sides, and B-BAND electronics.
This is one of Alvarez's bestselling guitars. The AG75CE is a great all-round instrument for live work or recording. The cedar/rosewood woods create a sophisticated look and the GA body shape is perfect. This Grand Auditorium has the same the scale length (25-1/2"") as their dreadnoughts, but a slightly smaller body with a narrower waist that accentuates the trebles.


The L.R. Baggs StagePro Element is a side-mounted preamp/EQ that offers battery access and a full chromatic tuner that is hidden beneath the control panel to maintain a clean, classy look. The three-band EQ with phase inversion and Garrett Null notch filter controls deliver warm, pristine sound even under the most challenging conditions.


Like all Artist Series guitars, the AG75CE is designed to get the best out if its components, and for them to work together to produce a tone...

Two-disc set Pagliaro Hit Parade collects 28 catchy rockers captured between 1969 and 1988. Recording in both official languages for much of his career, his string of early-'70s English gems like ""Loving You Ain't Easy,"" ""Rainshowers,"" and ""Some Sing, Some Dance"" constitute some of the best Badfinger songs that Badfinger never recorded (unless you're a native of Quebec, in which case the sentence becomes Badfinger's ""Day After Day"" is the best Pagliaro song that Pagliaro never recorded). The French material tends to more gritty, traditional rock & roll, led by his biggest hit ""J'Entends Frapper.""

The guitar has a super fast and slim neck with insanely easy access to the highest frets, decorative mother of pearl fret markers, and a locking trem that you can stomp with your foot and still be in tune. The active pickups sound killer thru my 100 watt Marshall. there's pretty much no dings. Tremolo arm included. Overall a fun guitar for a good chunk less than brand new price.

It's missing the trem cover plate, and there's no case. The guitar lives 2 blocks from Atlantic Terminal Guitar Center and can be shown on Friday thru Sunday.

I can't take less than 4 bills for it.

Hohner Brian May Steinberger $500


This is a very cool guitar, it's  a Hohner Steinberger copy, but rather than heavy epoxy resin, it's made of wood, specifically one solid piece of Hard Rock Maple for the neck-through design with small Pine wings for the body (not unlike the earliest Fender Broadcasters, Esquires and Telecasters !) .

What makes this guitar  really fun  is that it's been wired the same as Brian May's Red Special, each pickup has an on/off/phase switch and all three pickups are wired in series, exactly as Brian May did on his guitar..  The bridge pickup has a coil tap, too.

This simple arrangement was cleverly devised using only 3 switches, each with three positions: 

ON (in phase) / OFF / ON (out of phase)

This gives you the same pallate of colors as Brian May's famous axe..

This guitar  also shares a similar neck profile and tremolo design, too...!

Comes with gig bag and extra strings.

2018-02-25 07:23:00,"This is a 1950 Harmony Broadway Serial Number 1078H594. It is date stamped ""S-50-T"" which identifies it as being manufactured in the Summer of 1950. It has a number of bumps and bruises one would expect from a guitar that is almost 70 years old. There are two surface only cracks on the front: the first crack is on the upper right bout ~1.25"" from the binding and the second is right above the lower end of the left F hole. Again, these are surface only cracks and do not affect body integrity or sound. There is a series of scratches along one side of the neck starting 1"" below the nut. These, too, are surface only and do not affect the integrity of the neck structure or playability. The neck is straight and warp-free; there is no buzzing on any string up and down the neck; action is close; the guitar stays in tune. The checkered front binding is beautiful; the rear binding is plain. The pickguard is missing. Replacements may be found on the web. Its imperfections notwithstanding, this is a beautiful guitar that plays well and had a full, rich sound. This comes with a padded gig bag.

Back in the day, ART said: ""Power Plant combines the finest elements and saturation curves of 12AX7s into 6L6 tubes giving the user the thickest, heaviest crunch of classic tube amps without diction and articulation of notes! The Power Plant is one of the most versatile studio and live sound production tools available.

Fully bound neck and headstock, mother of pearl, abalone, ebony, double diamond headstock, high grade woods, and quality of construction.  Gorgeous in all respects, and one of Gibson's finest. It's sound and playing qualities are strikingly remarkable.

The Gibson J-185 EC Rosewood gives you legendary Gibson tone and build quality with great onboard electronics by Fishman. This jumbo offers easy playability, thanks to its 24-3/4"" scale and comfortable maple neck. The body size of the J-185 combines with its solid spruce top and Indian rosewood back/sides construction to give you a powerful, rich tone that you simply won't find in other guitars. Other features, such as the ebony fingerboard with split-block inlays, multi-ply binding, and Grover Rotomatic tuning machines make this a very special guitar.


This model is  now only available through special request, and manufactured by Gibson Custom Shop.

Gibson plush case is in new condition as well. Link provided below if you should seek specs.

From Gibson:
Gibson's J-185 EC Rosewood personifies the essence of aesthetic beauty and sonic excellence expected in a Gibson Jumbo acoustic. Its brilliance is felt as soon as the first chord is strummed, releasing the qualities and characteristics of a true legend. Gibson's J-185 EC Rosewood is everything a Jumbo acoustic should be, and then some. It starts with a premium Sitka spruce top matched with some of the finest Indian rosewood in the world for the back and sides, giving the J-185 EC Rosewood a warm, rich tone together with the usual full lows and well-defined highs.

2018-02-24 20:32:00,"The Heil PR 40 microphone boasts the widest frequency range of any dynamic mic in the Heil PR series. The PR 40 incorporates Heil's sage-like understanding of phasing plug placement, along with the use of a very large (1″), low mass diaphragm, and custom magnet metals housed in a specially designed microphone body.

The PR 40 diaphragm is shock mounted such that it is completely de-coupled from the anodized Champagne matte-finished steel body. In addition to dual mesh screens, each made with different diameter screen apertures, there is an internal breath blast filter on the diaphragm element itself, providing superb response for the human voice across the entire vocal range, without ""popping"" noises. In fact, the PR 40 will provide flawless, smooth, flat response from 28 Hz all the way up to the 18k Hz, making this a great microphone for everything from vocals, to bass drums and tom drums, to guitar and bass cabinet mic'ing and more.

In short, the PR 40 is known by professionals as the ""thoroughbred work-horse"" of professional sound recording and reinforcement.

The PR 40 is available in champagne, gold plate, or chrome plate. With all PR 40 models you get an adjustable cast metal microphone holder in a padded Leatherette bag with molded foam insert.

The SR1305E is a stylish 5-string bass that begins with a beautiful Ash and Walnut top/Mahogany body combination that produces a robust, full balanced tone. Features include a 5-piece Wenge/Bubinga Atlas-5 neck for superior stability and a Rosewood fretboard with striking Abalone oval inlays.

Sustain and string vibration are optimized by the innovative Mono-Rail V bridge system and super-smooth, hand-crimped Medium frets - finished with the Premium Fret Edge Treatment - make this handsome bass as enjoyable to play, as it is to look at.

For electronics, the SR1300E comes loaded with two Nordstrand Big Single pickups.

Additional sound shaping is provided by an Ibanez Ibanez Custom Electronics EQ.

Equalization controls include a 3-band Active EQ with a bypass switch and a mid frequency switch for the ultimate in tone management. When the EQ bypass is activated, the treble tone control knob becomes the global tone control for the passive circuit.

2018-02-24 17:13:00,"This is a one-of-kind prototype of the Warwick Corvette RockBass. I purchased this from the long-time Warwick distributor, Dana B Goods. 

It varies from the production model they settled on in several ways. The most obvious is the color. It's red stain is much nicer and classier than the blue stained or gloss black versions that were originally offered. The body is made of two nicely matched pieces of alder rather than three poorly matched pieces. The pickups are the German passive MEC Silver single-coils which were not initially offered. They sound much better than the active MECs which had a harsh metallic sound and even with the treble turned down, you could never approach the classic Jazz Bass sound of these pickups with the dual passive tone controls. No batteries needed and less to go wrong. The pickup locations are more like that of a 70's Fender Jazz which contributes to the aggressive growl these are known for. The neck construction varies slightly as well. It's a 2-piece maple neck with a satin finish. If you've ever played a German-made version, you'll understand why the necks are often compared to baseball bats. Not so with this one as it is much more comfortable. You might also note that the RockBass logo on this is smaller than the production model. It uses the German one-piece cast bridge from the Streamer Standard. As this is a prototype model, there is no serial number engraved into the neck. It's much lighter and more comfortable than a bubinga Corvette. And because of the clear coat, it will stay looking nice where the bubinga and swamp ash models will quickly show wear. I've included a photo showing it next to a German swamp ash model.

It is in MINT condition with only a few hours of play on it. Zero fret wear, straight neck, nice low action. Shortly after buying this bass, which was my introduction to Warwick, I picked up a used swamp ash model which was already worn so I played that one and kept this, unplayed, in a gig bag. I love this bass but simply can't justify that luxury anymore. I actually like this more than my swamp ash model. The grain is much nicer, it's lighter and the neck is much more comfortable. It also has the added versatility of being able to set the tone of each pickup separately. The pickups are identical.

I will include a used Warwick Deluxe Gig Bag

If you are interested, I have available a black Warwick bridge as well as a new set of black Gotoh tuners and black knobs as I was planning on swapping all the hardware from chrome to black. 

It currently has Fender Flatwounds on but I will install a new set of LaBella roundwounds, your choice of steel or nickel.

SERIOUS ONLY. I'm not Guitar Center and have no time for tire-kickers.    ",https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/msg/d/warwick-corvette-prototype/6508988251.html,480.0,Warwick Corvette Prototype RockBass

Also, not all of these guitars had the intense curly maple flame top like this one does. Paul Stanley and Ace Frehley both own one of these guitars. Also, Joe Perry once played this guitar back in 1980. These guitars have been called The Holy Grail by an article in vintage guitar magazine, that is if you can actually find one for sale and too because only a handful of these guitars were made. Also, the only way to document the guitar is by the original bill of sale or the newsletter sent out which I still have when I purchased it in 1978 from Strings and Things in Memphis TN. The first guitar on the right in the picture of the newsletter is a picture of this guitar without the sunburst finish on it.

Want more than 2 tickets? Not a problem for this rocking Andrew Lloyd Webber production.

Based on the hit film, this hilarious new musical follows Dewey Finn, a failed, wannabe rock star who decides to earn a few extra bucks by posing as a substitute teacher at a prestigious prep school. There he turns a class of straight-A students into a guitar-shredding, bass-slapping, mind-blowing rock band. While teaching these pint-sized prodigies what it means to truly rock, Dewey falls for the school's beautiful, but uptight headmistress, helping her rediscover the wild child within.

Comes with rack ears.
Cash only!
Thank You!


The Great River ME-1NV features iron in the signal path for that big vintage sound. Its no-latency output monitoring provides a buffered sound feed to your DAW workstation.

Here's the bottom line. The Great River ME-1NV is a golden channel priced for the project studio and equally at home in a world class facility. This preamp has the ability to enhance the sound of high-end mics as well as being able to make inexpensive mics sound better.

2018-02-24 10:44:00,"The Comanche is G&L's flagship model, a design directly influenced by Leo Fender's entire life and work. This guitar has gone through 14 years of non-stop playing by a professional musician in Brooklyn, making it well seasoned, opening up the tonal qualities of the wood. There is truly something magical about this guitar in particular, from the highly figured wood to its tonal characteristics, having a glassy top end with still a very robust bottom. 
 It has some wear but the structure and playability was never affected, giving the instrument a true vintage vibe. The biggest blemish is on the lower bout (shown in pictures). The neck is tapered, starting slim near the nut and gradually going to a medium profile towards the bridge, giving the perfect medium from playing open chords to having the space needed for intricate solos in the upper register.  It has been professionally setup in the beginning of last year and the action/intonation has stayed put since. The pick guard, originally white, has turned over time into a lovely gold color, which you never see on Comanches. The instrument is balance and the body has been shaped so well, it really fits like a glove. 
 This guitar is versatile! It has 3 hum canceling Z-coil pickups and a mini toggle expander switch that engages multiple pickups at the same time, ranging from a true Stratocaster sound to a beefier Humbucker. Finishing touches feature locking tuners, a whammy bar (not shown), birds eye maple neck (finished with gun oil), and a swamp ash body. Any serious questions please feel free to message. Visit the G&L website for specs and write up.

-Maple neck with black dock inlays
-S-1 switching with a push button in the volume knob

It has a number of markings, lots of pick scratches (I've considered replacing the pickguard, but it never really bothered me enough to do so), some chips on the sides of the body, etc. 

I am not interested in any trades or offers, price is final. You won't get a better strat for a grand, and I don't need to get rid of it - I'd just as soon keep it if it doesn't sell here. I'm trying to downsize my collection a bit and this one is a bit too nice for my limited current needs.

Moog MF Flange - $189 new, will take $125

Will make a deal if buying both. Also open to trades, but pretty specific ones. I'm looking for a Caroline Kilobyte delay, possibly moogerfoogers.

2018-02-24 08:58:00,"This is an impeccably built 1964 Fender Deluxe Reverb Clone down to every last detail. 

Make an offer and it could be yours!

BFDR Build by Stu-Daddy Amps of Warren, MI


It is a hand wired replica of a 1964 Fender Deluxe Reverb guitar amplifier, handwired by Stu Daddy. This amp is the finest replica you can buy, in my opinion. This amp provides a tweed tone stack (channel 1) and a stock deluxe reverb tone stack (channel 2) and will overdrive very nicely. This is the same setup that he handwired for Johnny Lang's deluxe reverb amps. Approximate output is 20W. The 1964 Blackface Deluxe Reverb circuit design is the AB763 with reverb circuit. 


This version of the circuit in this amp is slightly modded and does away with the double redundancy of 2 channel Blackface Fender amps. Of course these mods are undoable and the stock circuit is always available. 

This version turns channel 1 the normal channel into a tweed/brown tone stack and he also equally weights both the normal and vibrato channels. The result is the Normal channel is as loud as the Vibrato channel with a bit more darker top end but with much more fatter midrange voice and the first order harmonics are richer.

Keep in mind that the Vibrato channel is kept stock. This allows for more tonal variations. The vibrato channel has the traditional Fender blackface tone, but this amp has a remarkably tight bottom end in either channel. The traditional 'farting out' usually experienced is gone.

With single coils the distortion is very 'Fendery' with bite appearing w/ hard pick attack at volume 4 in either channel and becoming more saturated evenly as selected amp channel is turned up. At ~ 8 on normal and ~ 9 on vibrato channel, headroom has disappeared and amp is nearly saturated. With slightly overwound single coils the amp drives a bit more, and P90's / Humbuckers bring a strong grind to the table as you'd expect. Distortion is even-ordered and very musical in either channel.

The amp works best with an A-B box. 'A' the Vibrato channel for clean and sparkling rythyms or leads, 'B' the normal channel for crunch or a Marshall-esque leads.

Many tonal combinations are possible, and unless you just have to have it, you can leave your stomps at home. Amp is remarkably quiet! With the modifications made to this circuit this amp will allow the player to cover all the musical styles of Rock,Blues and Country music with vintage blackface flavor.

*Specifications*
Hand built circuit board with tinned eyelets for flawless solder joints.
Solid pine finger jointed cabinet provides the warm round tone.

2018-02-23 19:38:00,"Hello,

Looking to part with my 12 string Martin. Its up for sale or would trade for a small body/travel guitar like the Taylor Mini GS. It's in excellent condition, practically brand new 2016 model. Guitar has rarely been played, always kept in it's case and has been properly humidified to ensure no damages from dryness.  
The Martin D12X1AE 12-string Acoustic-electric Guitar sounds amazing; its a Martin!  It features a comfortable low-profile neck, low action, Great tone, looks, and playability. A Solid Sitka spruce top; mahogany grained HPL back and sides 
Also Fishman electronics sound great when plugged into amp.

If you're interested in buying or trading please email me. 

Thank you

First photo from an online review that looks just like my guitar.

Beautiful and great playing ALL USA PRS 2009 Mira core model with Standard carve neck in vintage cherry.  Super fine excellent condition and no issues. Pretty much like new all the way but feels like an aged  vintage guitar. With PRS hard case, case  candy, tools. Case has no issues.  I simply so not have any use for it and rather have the room. No trades.  Adult owned. Please do not ask for any more pictures. This is a really nice guitar and not easy to come by in this condition. Great action and so easy to play. I am not desperate to sell so no low-ballers or flippers just guitar players looking for a very nice guitar. No trades. I will accept serious offers though. 

Sorry about the dull photos but it is only way to see the true color which one does not get with a flash unless you are a pro guitar photographer, or at least better than me at it.  

****If interested send name and number and I will call you otherwise you will not get a response. Serious only no tire kickers.

I've had her reworked--new saddle, tuners, internal bracing--she's the priettiest damn guitar I have.

100% maple 00 body, rosewood fingerboard and mahogany neck --action is pristine.  This guitar sounds like myprewar stella, but with a little more mojo, and warmth. The new martins and taylor portable acoustic guitars being pushed hard right now wish they sounded like this instrument.  There is no warp, and the paint job is new.  You can't beat 80 year old natural wood resonance. Action is perfect--good for technical movement on the fretboard, but even if you strum her, you'll sound like Guthrie's accompaniment.

Functions include add octave, hold and repeat. Modes include transpose, volume adjustment, repeat rate, set midi channels, midi functions like vibrato and sustain when using a keyboard.  Intuitive and easy to use with any keyboard that has a midi-in.  Just connect via midi to your synthesizer and you can play with your feet.  Has 13 note pedals, i.e. one octave. 

It does more than just play notes on your synthesizer: it can start and stop your sequencer or drum machine, start various delayed (modulation wheel) vibrato ramps, turn glide on and off, add octave doubling, hold notes, repeat notes, act as a sustain pedal, set the volume on your MIDI module, octave transpose, and transpose into different keys (pitch offset). These actions can all be controlled from your feet, with out having to stoop down to change settings!!

It also plays polyphonically, so when used with the ""hold"" feature, you can form chords and stacks!! Or, if you are sitting down, you can do a ""two feet"" bass pedal performance.

Happy to send more photos upon request...Cash only.

Four multi-color LEDs notify you when the power is on, when the unit is charging, when the battery is low, and when the wireless mic is operating. Adjust the sound to your liking with the treble and bass controls. This amp even includes an echo knob for a wicked sounding voice effect.

This guitar has beautiful cleans all around, ESPECIALLY on the neck pickup. I'm selling this with everything I mentioned, and will also throw in the original pick ups as well as the gig bag that I bought along with it.

Do you want an amp that's pristine OR one that has battle scars and looks like it played many gigs.  If you want the pristine one - stop reading now.  If you want a Made in the USA (all the new ones are made in Mexico) vintage design then this one's for you.

I'm selling an 80's USA Built Fender Hot Rod Deville 410 as in 60 watts of power into four 10 inch speakers.  This amp rocks with a Clean and Distorted Channel plus a Spring Reverb - thats it. The electonics are MINT.  The amp was serviced last year.  All of the tubes, both input jacks and the Spring Reverb Tank was replaced.  All of the original Fender Eminence speakers are still there.

As you can see the tolex has battle scars and the speaker grille is worn but that's character from a long very well played life.  The controls have labels as most of the lettering has worn off.  The important thing is that behind that look you are getting electronics are excellent.

This amp also has removable wheels installed. The wheels just pull out of the sockets in the base.  I'm also including the original Fender Foot Pedal and a mint Fender cover.

TUBE CIRCUITRY
Simply put, there's really nothing quite like the pure, powerful sound of a Fender tube amplifier. For decades, the tonal richness and touch-sensitive dynamics of real tubes have given Fender amps a defining and unmistakable voice, as heard on most professional recordings and performances of the past 60 years--the music you've known your whole life.

SPRING REVERB - Not Electronic
Among their many fine sonic attributes, Fender guitar amps like this one are prized in particular for their luscious spring reverb. For that wet, shimmering ambient sound ranging from subtle to cavernous, Fender lets you dial it in exactly to taste.

EFFECTS LOOP
For perfect placement of your outboard effects in the signal chain, this amp features an effects loop with ¼"" preamp output and power amp input jacks.    ",https://newyork.craigslist.org/fct/msg/d/fender-hot-rod-deville-410/6506796249.html,425.0,Fender Hot Rod Deville 410 - USA Built

This is a quite rare Ibanez model, almost vintage I would say: it's been released in 1987 so it turns 30 this year.The finish is of course worn out here and there due to extensive usage; nevertheless it still plays really well: it's been regularly set up through the years and two years ago I had the whole fretboard refretted by a luthier here in NYC with stainless steel jumbo frets. All parts are original with the bridge humbucker being the exception: the original DiMarzio has been swapped with a Seymour Duncan Invader.The guitar comes with a hard case.

P.S. The volume and tone knobs have been recently replaced with new ones, purchased from Ibanez online store; also the plastic backplate has been replaced with a new one.

Album Notes
Personnel: Lenny Kravitz (vocals, guitar, organ, bass, drums); Slash, Adam Widoff (guitar); Nancy Ives (cello); Karl Denson, Butch Tomas (saxophone); Mike Hunter (trumpet); Sean Ono Lennon (piano); Henry Hirsch (keyboards, bass); Lebron Scott (bass); Zoro (drums).On MAMA SAID, Lenny Kravitz builds on the edgy soul-rock of his debut, streamlining his sound in both songcraft and production. The opener, ""Fields of Joy,"" moves from ethereal verses that evoke a bucolic summer's day to power-chord-heavy refrains and screaming guitar solos. The Stax/Volt-esque soul of ""Stand By My Woman,"" the bossa nova groove of ""What Goes Around Comes Around"" (which finds Kravitz mining a clear Curtis Mayfield influence), and the heavily phased rocker ""Stop Draggin' Around"" are all finely honed tributes to classic '60s and '70s sounds.That Kravitz is an unabashed fan of the old school is what, ultimately, makes his music so enjoyable, and he manages to synthesize his influences with style and economy. MAMA SAID's two standout tracks, ""Always on the Run"" and ""It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over,"" are cases in point. The former is a lean, riff-driven rock song that recalls both Jimi Hendrix and early Funkadelic; the latter a string-sweetened ballad that could have been pulled straight from the Philly Soul catalogue. Kravitz's flair for re-imagining rock, pop, and soul, topped by his fine production sense, keeps it all appealing. The buttons he pushes are no less pleasurable for being so familiar.

2018-02-22 14:09:00,"Hello!

I'm selling a pair of Shure KSM-141 microphones. I'm a professional classical musician and have used them to record about a dozen of my own concerts and to make a few audition recordings; but I haven't been using them recently. They are great microphones, very sensitive, well-respected by musicians and sound engineers, and will hopefully be put to good use again soon. They're also in very good condition - just a few small scratch marks on the surface of one of them (that I have shown in one of the pictures). These things are very durable and work perfectly!

I still have the carrying case, stereo microphone adapter, sponges, and paper manual. Also, I'd be happy to throw in a pair of mic stands (not pictured), though one is missing the end piece. (I will also be selling my Metric Halo ULN-2 Audio Interface soon, seperately.)

Please contact me for any questions or if you'd like to meet up to buy these (2) microphones (with included accessories)! 

In the meantime, here's some info about the Shur KSM-141 from Shure's website:

The KSM141 is a dual-pattern end-addressed condenser microphone with a rotating collar, allowing easy switching between a consistent cardioid or true omnidirectional polar pattern for smooth and extremely focused sound reproduction.

Designed for studio use, yet rugged enough for live applications, the KSM141 can withstand extremely high sound pressure levels (SPL). Its low self-noise and extended frequency response make it ideal for recording musical instruments.

FEATURES:

A mechanical polar pattern switch for highly consistent cardioid and true omnidirectional polar patterns. Provides flexibility in a wide variety of recording applications
Ultra-thin, 2.5 micron, 24 karat gold-layered, low mass Mylar® diaphragm for superior transient response
Class A, discrete, transformerless preamplifier for transparency, extremely fast transient response, no crossover distortion, and minimal harmonic and intermodulation distortion
Premium electronic components, including gold-plated internal and external connectors
Subsonic filter eliminates low frequency rumble (less than 17 Hz) caused by mechanical vibration
Three-position switchable pad (0 dB, 15 dB, and 25 dB) for handling extremely high sound pressure levels (SPLs)
Three-position switchable low-frequency filter to reduce background noise and counteract proximity effect

PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

Extended frequency response
Low self-noise
Exceptional reproduction of low-frequency sounds
Can withstand high sound pressure levels (SPL)
High output level
No crossover distortion
Uniform polar response
Superior common mode rejection and suppression of radio frequency interference

APPLICATIONS

Some typical applications for the KSM141 are listed below. Microphone use, however, is a matter of personal taste. The KSM141 may be used for a variety of applications other than those listed.

Acoustic instruments -- such as piano, guitar, drums, percussion, strings
Wind instruments -- brass and woodwind
Low frequency instruments -- such as double bass, electric bass, kick drum
Overhead miking -- drums or percussion
Ensembles -- choral or orchestral
Room ambiance pick-up -- guitar amplifier or drums    ",https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/ele/d/great-sensitive-microphones-2/6506286088.html,700.0,"Great, Sensitive Microphones - (2) Shure KSM-141"
