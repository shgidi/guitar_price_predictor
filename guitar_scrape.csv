EMMA Electronic PY-1 PisdiYAUwot Guitar Distortion Effect Pedal<br/>
Beauty In Brutality<br/>
You may have guessed it already, solely based on the looks of the PisdiYAUwot, this beast was made for METAL! The gain stage is raw and brutal yet extremely clear and defined. The EQ options are staggeringly versatile to say the least. The sound? Earthshakingly awesome! Chords, fast runs and triplets stand out with a clear and potent punch. No more mushy wobble, just power!<br/>
<br/>
Powerful and versatile high-gain pedal<br/>
Extremely tight and transparent attack - no mud, all metal!<br/>
Ultra-wide gain range - from low-gain to beyond high-gain<br/>
Highly intuitive control set - dial in amazing tones quick and easy<br/>
Top-mounted I/O<br/>
Handmade in Denmark<br/>
Untrue-Bypass switching - a super-transparent buffered bypass<br/>
The PisdiYAUwot is pure fire. It's lightning in a bottle. It's what every other metal pedal out there wishes to be. It's the sound of a tight and punchy high-gain amp in a box, ready to bring down the house on your command. The EQ section pots are optimized to work in interaction with each other, and the gain range is extremely wide. Turn down the MID a bit, turn up the HIGH and get that old school Pantera like scoop. Turn the MID up, the HIGH down a bit and the LOW up, and you get a very modern in your face mega power distortion. Want it more brutal, turn the GAIN down a bit. Want it more gritty, turn it up.<br/>
<br/>
This pedal will bring speed, power and clarity to any metal guitar player out there.    </section>]"

Here's a mojo filled Gibson ES-125TC from 1959. Featuring a Maple top, Mahogany sides, and an arched maple back. This Guitar has the original nitrocellulose lacquer finish, and is in 6/10 condition. The bridge is Brazilian Rosewood. The neck is beautiful, straight grain, quarter sawn Genuine Honduran Mahogany. The fretboard is Brazilian Rosewood, with Celluloid dot inlays. And it has a very desirable '59 spec neck, frets and original tuners.<br/>
<br/>
The head-stock is silk-screened with a gold Gibson logo, the tuners are the original 3 on a plate Kluson Deluxe tuners. Tuner buttons are solid and good for many more years of playing. The nut is original and made from nylon. The frets have just been polished, and have 70-75% life left. The neck is slightly concave and the truss rod is perfectly functional. <br/>
<br/>
The pickups are Gibson humbuckers and they sound beautiful and clear. The case is a Alligator-style Gibson guitar case and it's included. If you're looking for a golden age Gibson guitar without breaking the bank, this guitar is just for you. 1959 was a great year for Gibson guitars, now you have a chance to own one.<br/>

For your consideration is a vintage 1962 Gibson LG-0 acoustic guitar. The guitar overall is in good shape, and is looking for a new home. the headstock is clean, a few minor nicks and dings here and there, but nothing detrimental. The frets show some slight signs of use with YEARS of life left. The rosewood fret board looks astounding. The Mahogany body does have some minor signs of use, most notably observable finish checking, and some strum markings. <br/>
<br/>
Guitar plays well, and has a sixties slim melody maker type neck that feels incredible. This Guitar has a beautiful voice! It comes with an original period croc case that is not really a hardshell case. It is closer to a chipboard case.  For 56 years old, it's a beauty. It deserves a loving owner! Where were you in 62? Get behind this Gibson Guitar!<br/>

This is another very fine example of one of Paul's highly acclaimed and sought after guitars. He decided to retire after making his final guitar for Xuefei Yang a few years ago so these instruments are much harder to find these days.<br/>

The soundboard is Spruce with Brazilian Rosewood back and sides. I purchased this guitar in the late 1970s and it's been in storage since then. There are a few cracks in the soundboard and sides which were repaired long before I've owned it, and they are absolutely stable.<br/>

I don't know the year of making but it plays and sounds great now. The original ""coffin"" case hinges are in good condition but the latches need help. It's banged up a bit but structurally sound.<br/>

Extremely free resonance and response - all that you'd want from a great guitar like this. There are no cracks or repairs. The soundboard is Spruce with Mahogany back and sides. There are some surface scratches, dings, and wear from many years of playing, but overall in very good condition for this vintage. <br/>
<br/>
There are 2 metal ""plugs"" on either side of the headstock just below the tuner plates (as seen in the photos). We have scrutinized these mysterious ""plugs"" under magnifying glass and have no idea why they are there. It does not seem to be one unit going through the wood from one side to the other. If so, it would show at that point in the bass and treble string slots. There is no indication of a repair or break in the wood grain where they are. If anyone knows, please let us know.<br/>
<br/>
I've owned it since the late 1970s and its been in storage until only recently. <br/>

Spruce soundboard, Brazilian Rosewood back and sides. Very Good Condition.<br/>
<br/>
This is a really wonderful guitar with perfect balance, tone, volume and playability. It is what a great Spanish guitar should sound like in all registers.<br/>
<br/>
Marcelo BARBERO (hijo), famous in his own right, was the son of the very highly acclaimed and famous guitar maker, Marcelo Barbero. The guitar was made in the famous Arcangel Fernandez shop at Jesus y Maria 26 in Madrid. It is signed by Marcelo Barbero.<br/>
<br/>
The instrument was originally made as a classical guitar so the previous owner, a flamenco guitarist, had the fingerboard expertly replaced with a slightly thicker ebony so the action would be more flamenco like. It plays very nicely as a classical guitar and the fingerboard can be easily replaced with a thinner ebony to be a little more classical in feel as it was originally intended, though all who have played it, like it just the way it is. The installed tap plates can also be very easily removed for even more volume, resonance, and sustain.<br/>
<br/>
It is in very good condition with some surface wear. There are no cracks or repairs.<br/>

Great cocked wah and talking pedal sounds<br/>
Like getting three pedals in one: crying wah + talking wah (with adjustable frequency) plus a classic fuzz<br/>
Use with or w/out the fuzz. Place the fuzz before the filter for a vintage vibe or after for a more modern sound<br/>
Adjustable bias control takes the fuzz from ""normal"" to a classic"" dying battery"" sound<br/>
EXP input so you can sweep thewah and talking pedal with an expression pedal. Includes an EHX 9.6DC-200PSU, also works with 9V battery (not included).    </section>]"

great amp<br/>
<br/>
65Amps London 18 2x12 combo<br/>
<br/>
this is the ""Blue Label"" version, not the cheap version<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; it has the factory upgraded Mercury Magnetics transformers.  This was a special, more expensive factory version they offered, and these upgraded transformers have a huge impact on the sound.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; multiple voltage selector switch so you can play it internationally<br/>
<br/>
&gt; it's got UK-made Marshall Vintage G12s in it, which give it a great British tone<br/>
<br/>
&gt; it's in super condition ... and by the way, the Burgundy-color tolex is WAY more beautiful than my wimpy photos indicate<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and it sounds great<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2 x 12"" combo .... but thankfully for your back, lighter than a Twin Reverb / Vox AC 30 / Matchless DC 30<br/>

<br/>
this came out of an early Deacon<br/>
<br/>
it will also work for a Breadwinner<br/>
<br/>
you probably know that the 1st generation of Deacon / Breadwinners used this single-coil pickup.....later versions had the humbuckers<br/>
<br/>
so, this is a 1st generation pickguard assembly<br/>
<br/>
IT IS COMPLETE - meaning, you get everything you need to mount it.  Screws, etc.<br/>
<br/>
IT IS ALSO COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL.  All controls work, both pickups work, etc.  100% perfect functioning.<br/>
<br/>
It needs a bit of work.  Specifically, the neck pickup needs attention.  You need to 1) glue its back on.  2) attach the 3 mounting screws and springs (included).<br/>
<br/>
When I got the Deacon guitar, years ago, the neck pickup was 'loose' in the pickguard.  I took off the pickguard, and found that the neck pickup was not attached to the pickguard.  The wires were attached, just not the pickup itself.  Somebody, long ago, had 'checked' to see if it was functioning properly.  IT DOES.  And it did, way back then; they even wrote 'OK' on the back of the pickup.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you buy this, what you will get is a FULLY FUNCTIONAL, RIGHT NOW, pickguard assembly. <br/>
<br/>
However, unless you want that pickup knocking around, which I know you don't, you will need to 1) attach its back with glue.  and 2) use the 3 mounting screws and springs to mount it in the pickguard.<br/>
<br/>
It comes with the original knobs, and some shiny knobs (currently mounted).  The pickguard has no cracks, but it does have a wear spot (shown in photos).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
FAQ:<br/>
&gt; do both pickups work.  Yes.<br/>
&gt; do the controls work.  Yes.<br/>
&gt; does it come with all the screws.  Yes.    </section>]"

Roland GR-50 guitar synthesizer in very good condition for $95. You will need to provide your own guitar with a GK-2 pickup to test it, as I no longer have a GK-2.<br/>
Please provide a phone number if interested.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With a new slimmer pickup system and digital synthesizer engine based on the highly regarded D-50 synthesizer, Roland released the GR-50 Guitar Synthesizer in 1988. The GR-50 system featured Roland's new proprietary GK-2A Divided Pickup and 13 pin cable. Now users can use their own guitar with the GK-2A pickup system installed. The GR-50 can also function as a multitimbral sound engine. The GK-2A Divided Pickup has two assignable buttons and a volume knob that can be assigned to control chosen real time parameters on the GR-50 module.<br/>
<br/>
The sounds of the GR-50 are based on the Linear Arithmetic (LA) sound system. Where by the structure of a given sound is based on tones broken down into pairs called partials . With a partial you can select to use a synthesizer sound which is like a conventional analog synthesizer or a PCM sound which is a sampled waveform. Deeper editing of the sound engine can be done with the optional PG-10 programmer but all editing can be done from the front panel.<br/>
<br/>
The Gr-50 has 128 Preset tones with 64 user available and can expand to an additional 64 user presets with a memory card. The GR-50 is 3 part multitimbral when used as a stand alone MIDI sound module. 2 synthesizer parts and 1 rhythm part. Additionally there are 64 rhythm tones and additional 64 rhythm tones are available with a memory card.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to playing synth tones on the GR-50 the player can also play additional MIDI synthesizers in combination with the GR-50's sounds or the external MIDI instrument(s). Complex layers of sound can be created with what Roland refers to as branching. Where by layers of sounds are spread across the guitar fretboard with each string having the ability to have split points and layers much in the same way as on a MIDI keyboard. Sounds can be played from selected strings that are on board the GR-50, over MIDI, or both. Additionally strings can also be muted and have just their guitar sound sent out through the guitar output or completely muted.<br/>
<br/>
Optionally the user can control program changes and expression with the FC-100 foot pedal and EV-5/EV-10 expression pedals.The GR-50 can be played by older Roland Guitar and Bass Controllers by using the optional BC-13 Bus Converter. <br/>

<br/>
and then, he quit making them.  So they are rare.<br/>
<br/>
this one is like a Voxer 18 except it's got more wattage (33 vs 18) due to the 2 extra EL-84 tubes, and it's got more controls on the panel....so you can sculpt the sound more<br/>
<br/>
Greenback / Blue Alnico 'mismatched' speakers.... 8 ohms each ....<br/>
<br/>
everything regarding the amp is 100% original<br/>
<br/>
it's been babied it's whole life<br/>

great old PRS 'metal badge' case  - from the 80s / early 90s<br/>
<br/>
excellent vintage condition<br/>
<br/>
no smells<br/>
<br/>
no pet stains<br/>
<br/>
all latches work<br/>
<br/>
case is structurally sound, no cracks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
it's got some whitish stuff on a small part of the top...not sure what that is, it's not paint...anyway, you can take if off if you choose<br/>
<br/>
it's in nice vintage shape<br/>
<br/>
100% authentic<br/>

This Fender Electric Guitars - 2006 American Deluxe Telecaster has all the great appointments and classic playability inside the iconic Telecaster package with an upgraded set of pickups. The exceptional Blues Special pickups from Lindy Fralin ring like a bell, apt to push an amp for sustained soaring bends, or thin chop comp'd chords. The neck pickup has a remarkable open low end with a crispness to the highs reminiscent of near strat-like tones. The punch then comes from the bridge pickup; make no mistake, this is a Telecaster treat. With the pickup selector set to the middle position, the S1 switch allows for arranging the pickups in parallel or in series. This proves very nice for someone looking to have a gigging tele with some extra versatility. The maple neck feels fast and soft, and comes with a bright, woody sound. The slick top binding, abalone inlays and a pearl pickgaurd round off its noticeably handsome appearance. Included Original hardshell case<br/>

Selling my Steinberger. It's one of the 90s HSH guitars. It has an Active EMG pickup setup of 81/SA/85 (So it takes some 9v batteries) and an R-Trem system. Neat looking, and fits in a small case despite the full size neck and body. It's a great guitar, but I never really got into playing as work and school have been dominating my life. It takes a double-ball string, but there is a conversion to single-ball on eBay.<br/>
<br/>
It'll come with the tremolo bar, and gig bag. The gig bag is a bit torn up on the inside but still functional, the guitar shows normal scuffing and wear from a twenty year old guitar.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for $450 for it. I'm open to trades, but I'm primarily looking for a Fender Bass, or AR stuff. E-Mail me!<br/>

Vintage Yamaha acoustic guitar small body and cool shape. Guitar is from late 60- early 70's. Model fg170. . I really enjoy the body size of guitar I can stand up and hold and play. The tuners feel sturdy as well as stock. There has been a truss rod adjustment to lower string height. Very easy to play folk style but harder to jam with action and no cutaway towards the twelve fret. Really great instrument<br/>
Awesome for song writing, camping couch guitar. Good for beginner or everyday player like myself who sometimes prefer these vintage laminate Yamahas    </section>]"

Why use a buffer? <br/>
<br/>
With the rise of true bypass pedals, buffers sometimes get a bad name. Some players have come to associate buffers with tone loss. However, without at least one buffer in your signal path, you may be actually losing tone, particuarly your high-end. This simple pedal can breathe new life into your pedal--especially if you are feeling like there is ""tone-suck"" along your pedal path. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This small pedal can drastically improve your tone, and allow you to regain the natural character of your amp--even with a large pedalboard. I encourage you to check out this video that explains the nature of buffers while demonstrating side-by-side demonstrations of its benefits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOWeoizp4y0    </section>]"

</div>
Selling my G&amp;L Tribute Junior II in near-mint condition with minimal use and has never been played out of my home..  I've had it professionally set-up and the action and intonation are near-perfect.  I also had the little knob on the headstock that G&amp;L uses removed, as it looks much better without it.   Will include a gig bag with purchase.  No trades please.<br/>
Please see photos and email me with any questions.  Must move, asap, so only $300.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the write-up and specs on this dandy:<br/>
<br/>
The ASAT Junior II carries two Paul Gagon-designed P90 pickups, specially spec'd to deliver stellar tones in each position and with matched output for more truly usable rhythm/lead switching. No more fumbling with the volume trying to find balance between the P90s.<br/>
<br/>
The Junior II features an easy-playing, medium-C profile neck with 12"" radius and 1-5/8"" nut width for a classic ASAT feel that greets the hand like an old friend. Add on Tone-Pros bridge/tailpiece hardware, delicious Irish Ale-finished mahogany body and hard rock maple neck with Rosewood board and you've got one versatile ASAT that effortlessly covers a wide range of sonic territory.<br/>
<br/>
The Junior II has popped up before in short-run Custom Creations models made at G&amp;L's Fullerton, California shop, but this is the first time it's been this widely available. On top of that, it's part of G&amp;L's Tribute Series, which has been garnering rave reviews for more than a decade thanks to its solid combination of tone, quality and value.<br/>
FEATURES<br/>
<br/>
Construction: Bolt-on<br/>
Scale: 25-1/2""<br/>
Pickups: G&amp;L AP4285B in neck position, G&amp;L AP42105B in bridge position; Designed by Paul Gagon<br/>
Body wood: Mahogany<br/>
Neck wood: Hard-rock maple with rosewood fingerboard<br/>
Neck Radius: 12""<br/>
Frets: 22 medium jumbo<br/>
Neck width at nut: 1-5/8""<br/>
Neck profile: Medium C<br/>
Bridge: Tone-Pros locking C-TPFP bridge and CT1 tailpiece<br/>
Controls: 3-position pickup selector, volume, tone<br/>
